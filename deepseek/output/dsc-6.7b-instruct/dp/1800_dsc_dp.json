Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: A $\\mathbf{0}$-indexed array $a$ of size $n$ is called good if for all valid indices $i$ ($0 \\le i \\le n-1$), $a_i + i$ is a perfect square$^\\dagger$.\n\nGiven an integer $n$. Find a permutation$^\\ddagger$ $p$ of $[0,1,2,\\ldots,n-1]$ that is good or determine that no such permutation exists.\n\n$^\\dagger$ An integer $x$ is said to be a perfect square if there exists an integer $y$ such that $x = y^2$.\n\n$^\\ddagger$ An array $b$ is a permutation of an array $a$ if $b$ consists of the elements of $a$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[4,2,3,4]$ is a permutation of $[3,2,4,4]$ while $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation of $[1,2,3]$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe only line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the length of the permutation $p$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output $n$ distinct integers $p_0, p_1, \\dots, p_{n-1}$ ($0 \\le p_i \\le n-1$) \u2014 the permutation $p$ \u2014 if the answer exists, and $-1$ otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n3\n3\n4\n7\nOutput\n1 0 2 \n0 3 2 1 \n1 0 2 6 5 4 3\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, we have $n=3$. The array $p = [1, 0, 2]$ is good since $1 + 0 = 1^2$, $0 + 1 = 1^2$, and $2 + 2 = 2^2$\n\nIn the second test case, we have $n=4$. The array $p = [0, 3, 2, 1]$ is good since $0 + 0 = 0^2$, $3 + 1 = 2^2$, $2+2 = 2^2$, and $1+3 = 2^2$. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: There is a chessboard of size $n$ by $n$. The square in the $i$-th row from top and $j$-th column from the left is labelled $(i,j)$.\n\nCurrently, Gregor has some pawns in the $n$-th row. There are also enemy pawns in the $1$-st row. On one turn, Gregor moves one of his pawns. A pawn can move one square up (from $(i,j)$ to $(i-1,j)$) if there is no pawn in the destination square. Additionally, a pawn can move one square diagonally up (from $(i,j)$ to either $(i-1,j-1)$ or $(i-1,j+1)$) if and only if there is an enemy pawn in that square. The enemy pawn is also removed.\n\nGregor wants to know what is the maximum number of his pawns that can reach row $1$?\n\nNote that only Gregor takes turns in this game, and the enemy pawns never move. Also, when Gregor's pawn reaches row $1$, it is stuck and cannot make any further moves.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1\\le t\\le 2\\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2\\le n\\le 2\\cdot{10}^{5}$) \u2014 the size of the chessboard.\n\nThe second line consists of a string of binary digits of length $n$, where a $1$ in the $i$-th position corresponds to an enemy pawn in the $i$-th cell from the left, and $0$ corresponds to an empty cell.\n\nThe third line consists of a string of binary digits of length $n$, where a $1$ in the $i$-th position corresponds to a Gregor's pawn in the $i$-th cell from the left, and $0$ corresponds to an empty cell.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases is less than $2\\cdot{10}^{5}$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of Gregor's pawns which can reach the $1$-st row.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n3\n000\n111\n4\n1111\n1111\n3\n010\n010\n5\n11001\n00000\nOutput\n3\n4\n0\n0\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Gregor can simply advance all $3$ of his pawns forward. Thus, the answer is $3$.\n\nIn the second example, Gregor can guarantee that all $4$ of his pawns reach the enemy row, by following the colored paths as demonstrated in the diagram below. Remember, only Gregor takes turns in this \"game\"!\n\nIn the third example, Gregor's only pawn is stuck behind the enemy pawn, and cannot reach the end.\n\nIn the fourth example, Gregor has no pawns, so the answer is clearly $0$. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Dreamoon is standing at the position 0 on a number line. Drazil is sending a list of commands through Wi-Fi to Dreamoon's smartphone and Dreamoon follows them.\n\nEach command is one of the following two types:   Go 1 unit towards the positive direction, denoted as '+'  Go 1 unit towards the negative direction, denoted as '-' \n\nBut the Wi-Fi condition is so poor that Dreamoon's smartphone reports some of the commands can't be recognized and Dreamoon knows that some of them might even be wrong though successfully recognized. Dreamoon decides to follow every recognized command and toss a fair coin to decide those unrecognized ones (that means, he moves to the 1 unit to the negative or positive direction with the same probability 0.5). \n\nYou are given an original list of commands sent by Drazil and list received by Dreamoon. What is the probability that Dreamoon ends in the position originally supposed to be final by Drazil's commands?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a string s_1 \u2014 the commands Drazil sends to Dreamoon, this string consists of only the characters in the set {'+', '-'}. \n\nThe second line contains a string s_2 \u2014 the commands Dreamoon's smartphone recognizes, this string consists of only the characters in the set {'+', '-', '?'}. '?' denotes an unrecognized command.\n\nLengths of two strings are equal and do not exceed 10.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single real number corresponding to the probability. The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10^{ - 9}.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n++-+-\n+-+-+\n\nOutput\n1.000000000000\n\nInput\n+-+-\n+-??\n\nOutput\n0.500000000000\n\nInput\n+++\n??-\n\nOutput\n0.000000000000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first sample, both s_1 and s_2 will lead Dreamoon to finish at the same position  + 1. \n\nFor the second sample, s_1 will lead Dreamoon to finish at position 0, while there are four possibilites for s_2: {\"+-++\", \"+-+-\", \"+--+\", \"+---\"} with ending position {+2, 0, 0, -2} respectively. So there are 2 correct cases out of 4, so the probability of finishing at the correct position is 0.5. \n\nFor the third sample, s_2 could only lead us to finish at positions {+1, -1, -3}, so the probability to finish at the correct position  + 3 is 0. \n\n### Response:\n",

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Therasa is a Nurse. She wants to give some tablets to the patients in her practice.  All the patients sit in a line and each of them  has a rating score according to his or her health score. Therasa wants to give at least 1 tablet for each patient. Patients get jealous of their immediate neighbors, so if two patients sit next to each other then the one with the higher rating must get more tablets. Therasa wants to save money, so she wants to minimize the total number of tablets.  \n\nInput\nThe first line of the input is an integer N, the number of patients in Therasa\u2019s practice. Each of the following N lines contains an integer indicates the health score of each patient.\n\nOutput\nOutput a single line containing the minimum number of tablets Therasa must give.\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100000\n1 \u2264 health score \u2264 100000  \n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n3\n1\n2\n2\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\n4\n\nExplanation\n\nHere 1, 2, 2 is the health score.

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Hossam makes a big party, and he will invite his friends to the party.\n\nHe has $n$ friends numbered from $1$ to $n$. They will be arranged in a queue as follows: $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n$.\n\nHossam has a list of $m$ pairs of his friends that don't know each other. Any pair not present in this list are friends.\n\nA subsegment of the queue starting from the friend $a$ and ending at the friend $b$ is $[a, a + 1, a + 2, \\ldots, b]$. A subsegment of the queue is called good when all pairs of that segment are friends.\n\nHossam wants to know how many pairs $(a, b)$ there are ($1 \\le a \\le b \\le n$), such that the subsegment starting from the friend $a$ and ending at the friend $b$ is good.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$), the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integer numbers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $0 \\le m \\le 10^5$) representing the number of friends and the number of pairs, respectively.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($1 \\le x_i, y_i\\le n$, $x_i \\neq y_i$) representing a pair of Hossam's friends that don't know each other.\n\nNote that pairs can be repeated.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$, and the sum of $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print an integer \u2014 the number of good subsegments.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n2\n3 2\n1 3\n2 3\n4 2\n1 2\n2 3\nOutput\n4\n5\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, the answer is $4$.\n\nThe good subsegments are:\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[1, 2]\n\nIn the second example, the answer is $5$.\n\nThe good subsegments are:\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\n[4]\n\n[3, 4] \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: You may have heard of the pie rule before. It states that if two people wish to fairly share a slice of pie, one person should cut the slice in half, and the other person should choose who gets which slice. Alice and Bob have many slices of pie, and rather than cutting the slices in half, each individual slice will be eaten by just one person.\n\nThe way Alice and Bob decide who eats each slice is as follows. First, the order in which the pies are to be handed out is decided. There is a special token called the \"decider\" token, initially held by Bob. Until all the pie is handed out, whoever has the decider token will give the next slice of pie to one of the participants, and the decider token to the other participant. They continue until no slices of pie are left.\n\nAll of the slices are of excellent quality, so each participant obviously wants to maximize the total amount of pie they get to eat. Assuming both players make their decisions optimally, how much pie will each participant receive?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nInput will begin with an integer N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 50), the number of slices of pie. \n\nFollowing this is a line with N integers indicating the sizes of the slices (each between 1 and 100000, inclusive), in the order in which they must be handed out.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two integers. First, the sum of the sizes of slices eaten by Alice, then the sum of the sizes of the slices eaten by Bob, assuming both players make their decisions optimally.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n141 592 653\n\nOutput\n653 733\n\nInput\n5\n10 21 10 21 10\n\nOutput\n31 41\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Bob takes the size 141 slice for himself and gives the decider token to Alice. Then Alice gives the size 592 slice to Bob and keeps the decider token for herself, so that she can then give the size 653 slice to herself. \n\n### Response:\n",

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: One day Polycarp published a funny picture in a social network making a poll about the color of his handle. Many of his friends started reposting Polycarp's joke to their news feed. Some of them reposted the reposts and so on.\n\nThese events are given as a sequence of strings \"name1 reposted name2\", where name1 is the name of the person who reposted the joke, and name2 is the name of the person from whose news feed the joke was reposted. It is guaranteed that for each string \"name1 reposted name2\" user \"name1\" didn't have the joke in his feed yet, and \"name2\" already had it in his feed by the moment of repost. Polycarp was registered as \"Polycarp\" and initially the joke was only in his feed.\n\nPolycarp measures the popularity of the joke as the length of the largest repost chain. Print the popularity of Polycarp's joke.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200) \u2014 the number of reposts. Next follow the reposts in the order they were made. Each of them is written on a single line and looks as \"name1 reposted name2\". All the names in the input consist of lowercase or uppercase English letters and/or digits and have lengths from 2 to 24 characters, inclusive.\n\nWe know that the user names are case-insensitive, that is, two names that only differ in the letter case correspond to the same social network user.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum length of a repost chain.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\ntourist reposted Polycarp\nPetr reposted Tourist\nWJMZBMR reposted Petr\nsdya reposted wjmzbmr\nvepifanov reposted sdya\n\nOutput\n6\n\nInput\n6\nMike reposted Polycarp\nMax reposted Polycarp\nEveryOne reposted Polycarp\n111 reposted Polycarp\nVkCup reposted Polycarp\nCodeforces reposted Polycarp\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n1\nSoMeStRaNgEgUe reposted PoLyCaRp\n\nOutput\n2 \n\n### Response:\n",

Otherwise, there is no coin on your board at time $t+1$.\n\nR: If at time $\\boldsymbol{\\boldsymbol{t}}$ the coin is on cell $(i,j)$ and cell $(i,j)$ has letter 'R', the coin will be on cell $(i,j+1)$ at time $t+1$, if $j<M$. Otherwise, there is no coin on your board at time $t+1$.\n\nWhen the coin reaches a cell that has letter '*', it will stay there permanently. When you punch on your board, your timer starts and the coin moves between cells. Before starting the game, you can make operations to change the board, such that you are sure that at or before time $\\boldsymbol{\\mbox{k}}$ the coin will reach the cell having letter '*'. In each operation you can select a cell with some letter other than '*' and change the letter to 'U', 'L', 'R' or 'D'. You need to carry out as few operations as possible in order to achieve your goal. Your task is to find the minimum number of operations. \n\nFor example, given a grid of $n=2$ rows and $m=3$ columns:\n\nUDL\nRR*\n\nthe goal is to get from $(1,1)$ to $(2,3)$ in as few steps as possible.  As the grid stands, it cannot be done because of the U in the cell at $(1,1)$.  If $(1,1)$ is changed to D, the path $(1,1)\\rightarrow(2,1)\\rightarrow(2,2)\\rightarrow(2,3)$ is available.  It could also be changed to R which would make the path $(1,1)\\rightarrow(1,2)\\rightarrow(2,2)\\rightarrow(2,3)$ available.  Either choice takes $1$ change operation, which is the value sought if $k\\geq3$.  A lower value of $\\boldsymbol{\\mbox{k}}$ would result in a return value of $-1$ because the shortest path is $3$ steps, starting from $(1,1)$.  \n\nFunction Description  \n\nComplete the coinOnTheTable function in the editor below.  It should return an integer that represents the minimum operations to achieve the goal, or $-1$ if it is not possible.  \n\ncoinOnTheTable has the following parameters:  \n\nm: an integer, the number of columns on the board  \nk: an integer, the maximum time to reach the goal  \nboard: an array of strings where each string represents a row of the board  \n\nInput Format\n\nThe first line of input contains three integers, $n$, $m$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\mbox{k}}$, the number of rows, the number of columns and the maximum time respectively.  \n\nThe next $n$ lines contain $m$ letters each, describing your board.   \n\nConstraints\n\n$n,m\\leq51$ \n\n$k\\leq1000$  \n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint an integer which represents the minimum number of operations required to achieve your goal.\nIf you cannot achieve your goal, print $-1$.\n\nSample Input\n2 2 3  \nRD  \n*L\n\nSample output :\n\n0\n\nSample input :\n\n2 2 1  \nRD  \n*L\n\nSample output :\n\n1\n\nExplanation :\n\nIn the first example, a valid path exists without making any changes.  In the second example, the letter of cell (1,1) must be changed to 'D' to make a valid path.  In each example, a path length $\\leq k$ is available. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: You and your friend are playing the game Mortal Kombat XI. You are trying to pass a challenge tower. There are $n$ bosses in this tower, numbered from $1$ to $n$. The type of the $i$-th boss is $a_i$. If the $i$-th boss is easy then its type is $a_i = 0$, otherwise this boss is hard and its type is $a_i = 1$.\n\nDuring one session, either you or your friend can kill one or two bosses (neither you nor your friend can skip the session, so the minimum number of bosses killed during one session is at least one). After your friend session, your session begins, then again your friend session begins, your session begins, and so on. The first session is your friend's session.\n\nYour friend needs to get good because he can't actually kill hard bosses. To kill them, he uses skip points. One skip point can be used to kill one hard boss.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of skip points your friend needs to use so you and your friend kill all $n$ bosses in the given order.\n\nFor example: suppose $n = 8$, $a = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]$. Then the best course of action is the following:\n\n  your friend kills two first bosses, using one skip point for the first boss;  you kill the third and the fourth bosses;  your friend kills the fifth boss;  you kill the sixth and the seventh bosses;  your friend kills the last boss, using one skip point, so the tower is completed using two skip points. \n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of bosses. The second line of the test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($0 \\le a_i \\le 1$), where $a_i$ is the type of the $i$-th boss.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$ ($\\sum n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of skip points your friend needs to use so you and your friend kill all $n$ bosses in the given order.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n6\n8\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n5\n1 1 1 1 0\n7\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n6\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\nOutput\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n0 \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Polygon is not only the best platform for developing problems but also a square matrix with side $n$, initially filled with the character 0.\n\nOn the polygon, military training was held. The soldiers placed a cannon above each cell in the first row and a cannon to the left of each cell in the first column. Thus, exactly $2n$ cannons were placed. [Image] Initial polygon for $n=4$. \n\nCannons shoot character 1. At any moment of time, no more than one cannon is shooting. When a 1 flies out of a cannon, it flies forward (in the direction of the shot) until it collides with a polygon border or another 1. After that, it takes the cell in which it was before the collision and remains there. Take a look at the examples for better understanding.\n\nMore formally:   if a cannon stands in the row $i$, to the left of the first column, and shoots with a 1, then the 1 starts its flight from the cell ($i, 1$) and ends in some cell ($i, j$);  if a cannon stands in the column $j$, above the first row, and shoots with a 1, then the 1 starts its flight from the cell ($1, j$) and ends in some cell ($i, j$). \n\nFor example, consider the following sequence of shots: [Image] \n\n 1. Shoot the cannon in the row $2$. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2. Shoot the cannon in the row $2$. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 3. Shoot the cannon in column $3$. \n\nYou have a report from the military training on your desk. This report is a square matrix with side length $n$ consisting of 0 and 1. You wonder if the training actually happened. In other words, is there a sequence of shots such that, after the training, you get the given matrix?\n\nEach cannon can make an arbitrary number of shots. Before the training, each cell of the polygon contains 0.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case starts with a line containing an integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$)\u00a0\u2014 the size of the polygon.\n\nThis is followed by $n$ lines of length $n$, consisting of 0 and 1\u00a0\u2014 the polygon matrix after the training.\n\nThe total area of the matrices in all test cases in one test does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print:  YES if there is a sequence of shots leading to a given matrix;  NO if such a sequence does not exist. \n\nThe letters in the words YES and NO can be printed in any case.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n4\n0010\n0011\n0000\n0000\n2\n10\n01\n2\n00\n00\n4\n0101\n1111\n0101\n0111\n4\n0100\n1110\n0101\n0111\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first test case was explained in the statement.\n\nThe answer to the second test case is NO, since a 1 in a cell ($1, 1$) flying out of any cannon would continue its flight further. \n\n### Response:\n",

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Scientists say a lot about the problems of global warming and cooling of the Earth. Indeed, such natural phenomena strongly influence all life on our planet.\n\nOur hero Vasya is quite concerned about the problems. He decided to try a little experiment and observe how outside daily temperature changes. He hung out a thermometer on the balcony every morning and recorded the temperature. He had been measuring the temperature for the last n days. Thus, he got a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n}, where the i-th number is the temperature on the i-th day.\n\nVasya analyzed the temperature statistics in other cities, and came to the conclusion that the city has no environmental problems, if first the temperature outside is negative for some non-zero number of days, and then the temperature is positive for some non-zero number of days. More formally, there must be a positive integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n - 1) such that t_1 < 0, t_2 < 0, ..., t_{k} < 0 and t_{k} + 1 > 0, t_{k} + 2 > 0, ..., t_{n} > 0. In particular, the temperature should never be zero. If this condition is not met, Vasya decides that his city has environmental problems, and gets upset.\n\nYou do not want to upset Vasya. Therefore, you want to select multiple values of temperature and modify them to satisfy Vasya's condition. You need to know what the least number of temperature values needs to be changed for that.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of days for which Vasya has been measuring the temperature. \n\nThe second line contains a sequence of n integers t_1, t_2, ..., t_{n} (|t_{i}| \u2264 10^9) \u2014 the sequence of temperature values. Numbers t_{i} are separated by single spaces.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the answer to the given task.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n-1 1 -2 1\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n5\n0 -1 1 2 -5\n\nOutput\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nNote to the first sample: there are two ways to change exactly one number so that the sequence met Vasya's condition. You can either replace the first number 1 by any negative number or replace the number -2 by any positive number. \n\n### Response:\n",

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Monocarp had a sequence $a$ consisting of $n + m$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{n + m}$. He painted the elements into two colors, red and blue; $n$ elements were painted red, all other $m$ elements were painted blue.\n\nAfter painting the elements, he has written two sequences $r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_m$. The sequence $r$ consisted of all red elements of $a$ in the order they appeared in $a$; similarly, the sequence $b$ consisted of all blue elements of $a$ in the order they appeared in $a$ as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the original sequence was lost, and Monocarp only has the sequences $r$ and $b$. He wants to restore the original sequence. In case there are multiple ways to restore it, he wants to choose a way to restore that maximizes the value of\n\n$$f(a) = \\max(0, a_1, (a_1 + a_2), (a_1 + a_2 + a_3), \\dots, (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \\dots + a_{n + m}))$$\n\nHelp Monocarp to calculate the maximum possible value of $f(a)$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases.

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Sherlock rolls a N faced die M times. He adds all the numbers he gets on all throws. What is the probability that he has a sum of K.   \n\nA N faced die has all numbers from 1 to N written on it and each has equal probability of arriving when dice is thrown.\n\nInput \nFirst line T, the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of M, N and K in one line.       \n\nOutput \nFor each testcase, print required probability in scientific notation as defined follows:   \nOutput should be of the form \"x y\" where x is a floating point integer less than 10 and greater than or equal to 1 and y is a integer. This notation is equivalent to x * 10^-y. x should be rounded and output till 3 decimal digits.   \nHowever, if probability is 0, output \"0.000 0\".     \n\nExamples:\nIf output is supposed to be 0.0034567, output should be \"3.457 3\".    \nIf output is supposed to be 0.3034567, output should be \"3.034 1\".     \n\nConstraints \n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10     \n1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 50       \n1 \u2264 K \u2264 10000       \n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n2\n1 5 2\n2 3 2\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\n2.000 1\n1.111 1\n\nExplanation\n\nFor first testcase, sum=1,2,3,4,5 are all equally probable. Hence probability is 0.2.\nFor second testcase:\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are all possible ways.\nOut of these 1 has sum 2.

The i-th line of these lines contains two integers u_{i} and v_{i} (1 \u2264 u_{i}, v_{i} \u2264 n, u_{i} \u2260 v_{i})\u00a0\u2014 the cities connected by the i-th road.\n\nIt is guaranteed that one can reach any city from any other by the roads.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a number\u00a0\u2014 the expected length of their journey. The journey starts in the city 1.\n\nYour answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.\n\nNamely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\\frac{|a - b|}{\\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \\leq 10^{-6}$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n\nOutput\n1.500000000000000\n\nInput\n5\n1 2\n1 3\n3 4\n2 5\n\nOutput\n2.000000000000000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, their journey may end in cities 3 or 4 with equal probability. The distance to city 3 is 1 and to city 4 is 2, so the expected length is 1.5.\n\nIn the second sample, their journey may end in city 4 or 5. The distance to the both cities is 2, so the expected length is 2. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Ron is a happy owner of a permutation a of length n.\n\nA permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).\n\n<image>\n\nRon's permutation is subjected to m experiments of the following type: (r_i, p_i). This means that elements in range [1, r_i] (in other words, the prefix of length r_i) have to be sorted in ascending order with the probability of p_i. All experiments are performed in the same order in which they are specified in the input data.\n\nAs an example, let's take a look at a permutation [4, 2, 1, 5, 3] and an experiment (3, 0.6). After such an experiment with the probability of 60\\% the permutation will assume the form [1, 2, 4, 5, 3] and with a 40\\% probability it will remain unchanged.\n\nYou have to determine the probability of the permutation becoming completely sorted in ascending order after m experiments.\n\nInput\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \u2264 t \u2264 100).\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \u2264 n, m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the length of the permutation and the number of experiments, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \u2026, a_n (1 \u2264 a_i \u2264 n) \u2014 contents of the permutation.\n\nThe following m lines of each test case each contain an integer r_i and a real number p_i (1 \u2264 r_i \u2264 n, 0 \u2264 p_i \u2264 1) \u2014 the length of the prefix and the probability of it being sorted. All probabilities are given with at most 6 decimal places.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m does not exceed 10^5 (\u2211 n, \u2211 m \u2264 10^5).\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a single number \u2014 the probability that after all experiments the permutation becomes sorted in ascending order. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{-6}.\n\nFormally, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is accepted if and only if \\frac{|a - b|}{max{(1, |b|)}} \u2264 10^{-6}.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n\n4\n4 3\n4 3 2 1\n1 0.3\n3 1\n4 0.6\n5 3\n4 2 1 3 5\n3 0.8\n4 0.6\n5 0.3\n6 5\n1 3 2 4 5 6\n4 0.9\n5 0.3\n2 0.4\n6 0.7\n3 0.5\n4 2\n1 2 3 4\n2 0.5\n4 0.1\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n0.600000\n0.720000\n0.989500\n1.000000\n\nNote\n\nExplanation of the first test case: It can be demonstrated that whether the final permutation is sorted or not depends solely on sorting being performed in the (4, 0.6) experiment. \n\n### Response:\n",

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Gildong owns a bulgogi restaurant. The restaurant has a lot of customers, so many of them like to make a reservation before visiting it.\n\nGildong tries so hard to satisfy the customers that he even memorized all customers' preferred temperature ranges! Looking through the reservation list, he wants to satisfy all customers by controlling the temperature of the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has an air conditioner that has 3 states: off, heating, and cooling. When it's off, the restaurant's temperature remains the same. When it's heating, the temperature increases by 1 in one minute. Lastly, when it's cooling, the temperature decreases by 1 in one minute. Gildong can change the state as many times as he wants, at any integer minutes. The air conditioner is off initially.\n\nEach customer is characterized by three values: $t_i$ \u2014 the time (in minutes) when the $i$-th customer visits the restaurant, $l_i$ \u2014 the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ \u2014 the upper bound of their preferred temperature range.\n\nA customer is satisfied if the temperature is within the preferred range at the instant they visit the restaurant. Formally, the $i$-th customer is satisfied if and only if the temperature is between $l_i$ and $h_i$ (inclusive) in the $t_i$-th minute.\n\nGiven the initial temperature, the list of reserved customers' visit times and their preferred temperature ranges, you're going to help him find if it's possible to satisfy all customers.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 500$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $-10^9 \\le m \\le 10^9$), where $n$ is the number of reserved customers and $m$ is the initial temperature of the restaurant.\n\nNext, $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line of them contains three integers $t_i$, $l_i$, and $h_i$ ($1 \\le t_i \\le 10^9$, $-10^9 \\le l_i \\le h_i \\le 10^9$), where $t_i$ is the time when the $i$-th customer visits, $l_i$ is the lower bound of their preferred temperature range, and $h_i$ is the upper bound of their preferred temperature range. The preferred temperature ranges are inclusive.\n\nThe customers are given in non-decreasing order of their visit time, and the current time is $0$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" if it is possible to satisfy all customers. Otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n3 0\n5 1 2\n7 3 5\n10 -1 0\n2 12\n5 7 10\n10 16 20\n3 -100\n100 0 0\n100 -50 50\n200 100 100\n1 100\n99 -100 0\n\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first case, Gildong can control the air conditioner to satisfy all customers in the following way:  At $0$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 0).  At $2$-nd minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 2).  At $5$-th minute, change the state to heating (the temperature is 2, the $1$-st customer is satisfied).  At $6$-th minute, change the state to off (the temperature is 3).  At $7$-th minute, change the state to cooling (the temperature is 3, the $2$-nd customer is satisfied).  At $10$-th minute, the temperature will be 0, which satisfies the last customer. \n\nIn the third case, Gildong can change the state to heating at $0$-th minute and leave it be. Then all customers will be satisfied. Note that the $1$-st customer's visit time equals the $2$-nd customer's visit time.\n\nIn the second and the fourth case, Gildong has to make at least one customer unsatisfied. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array) and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).\n\nConsider a permutation $p$ of length $n$, we build a graph of size $n$ using it as follows:   For every $1 \\leq i \\leq n$, find the largest $j$ such that $1 \\leq j < i$ and $p_j > p_i$, and add an undirected edge between node $i$ and node $j$  For every $1 \\leq i \\leq n$, find the smallest $j$ such that $i < j \\leq n$ and $p_j > p_i$, and add an undirected edge between node $i$ and node $j$ \n\nIn cases where no such $j$ exists, we make no edges. Also, note that we make edges between the corresponding indices, not the values at those indices.\n\nFor clarity, consider as an example $n = 4$, and $p = [3,1,4,2]$; here, the edges of the graph are $(1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(4,3)$.\n\nA permutation $p$ is cyclic if the graph built using $p$ has at least one simple cycle. \n\nGiven $n$, find the number of cyclic permutations of length $n$. Since the number may be very large, output it modulo $10^9+7$.\n\nPlease refer to the Notes section for the formal definition of a simple cycle\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and only line contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 10^6$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer $0 \\leq x < 10^9+7$, the number of cyclic permutations of length $n$ modulo $10^9+7$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n\nOutput\n16\nInput\n583291\n\nOutput\n135712853\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThere are $16$ cyclic permutations for $n = 4$. $[4,2,1,3]$ is one such permutation, having a cycle of length four: $4 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 4$.\n\nNodes $v_1$, $v_2$, $\\ldots$, $v_k$ form a simple cycle if the following conditions hold:   $k \\geq 3$.  $v_i \\neq v_j$ for any pair of indices $i$ and $j$. ($1 \\leq i < j \\leq k$)  $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ share an edge for all $i$ ($1 \\leq i < k$), and $v_1$ and $v_k$ share an edge. \n\n### Response:\n",

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Young wilderness explorers set off to their first expedition led by senior explorer Russell. Explorers went into a forest, set up a camp and decided to split into groups to explore as much interesting locations as possible. Russell was trying to form groups, but ran into some difficulties...\n\nMost of the young explorers are inexperienced, and sending them alone would be a mistake. Even Russell himself became senior explorer not long ago. Each of young explorers has a positive integer parameter $e_i$\u00a0\u2014 his inexperience. Russell decided that an explorer with inexperience $e$ can only join the group of $e$ or more people.\n\nNow Russell needs to figure out how many groups he can organize. It's not necessary to include every explorer in one of the groups: some can stay in the camp. Russell is worried about this expedition, so he asked you to help him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the number of independent test cases $T$($1 \\leq T \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$). Next $2T$ lines contain description of test cases.\n\nThe first line of description of each test case contains the number of young explorers $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line contains $N$ integers $e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_N$ ($1 \\leq e_i \\leq N$), where $e_i$ is the inexperience of the $i$-th explorer.\n\nIt's guaranteed that sum of all $N$ doesn't exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $T$ numbers, each number on a separate line.\n\nIn $i$-th line print the maximum number of groups Russell can form in $i$-th test case.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n3\n1 1 1\n5\n2 3 1 2 2\n\nOutput\n3\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example we can organize three groups. There will be only one explorer in each group. It's correct because inexperience of each explorer equals to $1$, so it's not less than the size of his group.\n\nIn the second example we can organize two groups. Explorers with inexperience $1$, $2$ and $3$ will form the first group, and the other two explorers with inexperience equal to $2$ will form the second group.\n\nThis solution is not unique. For example, we can form the first group using the three explorers with inexperience equal to $2$, and the second group using only one explorer with inexperience equal to $1$. In this case the young explorer with inexperience equal to $3$ will not be included in any group. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: There is a road with length $l$ meters. The start of the road has coordinate $0$, the end of the road has coordinate $l$.\n\nThere are two cars, the first standing at the start of the road and the second standing at the end of the road. They will start driving simultaneously. The first car will drive from the start to the end and the second car will drive from the end to the start.\n\nInitially, they will drive with a speed of $1$ meter per second. There are $n$ flags at different coordinates $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$. Each time when any of two cars drives through a flag, the speed of that car increases by $1$ meter per second.\n\nFind how long will it take for cars to meet (to reach the same coordinate). \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$): the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $l$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$, $1 \\leq l \\leq 10^9$): the number of flags and the length of the road.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ in the increasing order ($1 \\leq a_1 < a_2 < \\ldots < a_n < l$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ among all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print a single real number: the time required for cars to meet.\n\nYour answer will be considered correct, if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-6}$. More formally, if your answer is $a$ and jury's answer is $b$, your answer will be considered correct if $\\frac{|a-b|}{\\max{(1, b)}} \\leq 10^{-6}$.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n2 10\n1 9\n1 10\n1\n5 7\n1 2 3 4 6\n2 1000000000\n413470354 982876160\n9 478\n1 10 25 33 239 445 453 468 477\n\nOutput\n3.000000000000000\n3.666666666666667\n2.047619047619048\n329737645.750000000000000\n53.700000000000000\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case cars will meet in the coordinate $5$.\n\nThe first car will be in the coordinate $1$ in $1$ second and after that its speed will increase by $1$ and will be equal to $2$ meters per second. After $2$ more seconds it will be in the coordinate $5$. So, it will be in the coordinate $5$ in $3$ seconds.\n\nThe second car will be in the coordinate $9$ in $1$ second and after that its speed will increase by $1$ and will be equal to $2$ meters per second. After $2$ more seconds it will be in the coordinate $5$. So, it will be in the coordinate $5$ in $3$ seconds.\n\nIn the second test case after $1$ second the first car will be in the coordinate $1$ and will have the speed equal to $2$ meters per second, the second car will be in the coordinate $9$ and will have the speed equal to $1$ meter per second. So, they will meet after $\\frac{9-1}{2+1} = \\frac{8}{3}$ seconds. So, the answer is equal to $1 + \\frac{8}{3} = \\frac{11}{3}$. \n\n### Response:\n",

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: On a strip of land of length $n$ there are $k$ air conditioners: the $i$-th air conditioner is placed in cell $a_i$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$). Two or more air conditioners cannot be placed in the same cell (i.e. all $a_i$ are distinct).\n\nEach air conditioner is characterized by one parameter: temperature. The $i$-th air conditioner is set to the temperature $t_i$.\n\nExample of strip of length $n=6$, where $k=2$, $a=[2,5]$ and $t=[14,16]$.\n\nFor each cell $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le n$) find it's temperature, that can be calculated by the formula $$\\min_{1 \\le j \\le k}(t_j + |a_j - i|),$$\n\nwhere $|a_j - i|$ denotes absolute value of the difference $a_j - i$.\n\nIn other words, the temperature in cell $i$ is equal to the minimum among the temperatures of air conditioners, increased by the distance from it to the cell $i$.\n\nLet's look at an example. Consider that $n=6, k=2$, the first air conditioner is placed in cell $a_1=2$ and is set to the temperature $t_1=14$ and the second air conditioner is placed in cell $a_2=5$ and is set to the temperature $t_2=16$. In that case temperatures in cells are:\n\ntemperature in cell $1$ is: $\\min(14 + |2 - 1|, 16 + |5 - 1|)=\\min(14 + 1, 16 + 4)=\\min(15, 20)=15$;\n\ntemperature in cell $2$ is: $\\min(14 + |2 - 2|, 16 + |5 - 2|)=\\min(14 + 0, 16 + 3)=\\min(14, 19)=14$;\n\ntemperature in cell $3$ is: $\\min(14 + |2 - 3|, 16 + |5 - 3|)=\\min(14 + 1, 16 + 2)=\\min(15, 18)=15$;\n\ntemperature in cell $4$ is: $\\min(14 + |2 - 4|, 16 + |5 - 4|)=\\min(14 + 2, 16 + 1)=\\min(16, 17)=16$;\n\ntemperature in cell $5$ is: $\\min(14 + |2 - 5|, 16 + |5 - 5|)=\\min(14 + 3, 16 + 0)=\\min(17, 16)=16$;\n\ntemperature in cell $6$ is: $\\min(14 + |2 - 6|, 16 + |5 - 6|)=\\min(14 + 4, 16 + 1)=\\min(18, 17)=17$.\n\nFor each cell from $1$ to $n$ find the temperature in it.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input.

The first line contains two integers $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$) and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n$) \u2014 the length of the strip of land and the number of air conditioners respectively.\n\nThe second line contains $k$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le n$) \u2014 positions of air conditioners on the strip of land.\n\nThe third line contains $k$ integers $t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_k$ ($1 \\le t_i \\le 10^9$) \u2014 temperatures of air conditioners.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case output $n$ integers separated by space: temperatures of air in cells.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n5\n\n6 2\n2 5\n14 16\n\n10 1\n7\n30\n\n5 5\n3 1 4 2 5\n3 1 4 2 5\n\n7 1\n1\n1000000000\n\n6 3\n6 1 3\n5 5 5\nOutput\n15 14 15 16 16 17 \n36 35 34 33 32 31 30 31 32 33 \n1 2 3 4 5 \n1000000000 1000000001 1000000002 1000000003 1000000004 1000000005 1000000006 \n5 6 5 6 6 5\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nNone \n\n### Response:\n",

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Kyoya Ootori has a bag with n colored balls that are colored with k different colors. The colors are labeled from 1 to k. Balls of the same color are indistinguishable. He draws balls from the bag one by one until the bag is empty. He noticed that he drew the last ball of color i before drawing the last ball of color i + 1 for all i from 1 to k - 1. Now he wonders how many different ways this can happen. \n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input will have one integer k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 1000) the number of colors.\n\nThen, k lines will follow.

If there is no such substring, print $0$ instead.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n7\n123\n12222133333332\n112233\n332211\n12121212\n333333\n31121\n\nOutput\n3\n3\n4\n4\n0\n0\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the example test:\n\nIn the first test case, the substring 123 can be used.\n\nIn the second test case, the substring 213 can be used.\n\nIn the third test case, the substring 1223 can be used.\n\nIn the fourth test case, the substring 3221 can be used.\n\nIn the fifth test case, there is no character 3 in $s$.\n\nIn the sixth test case, there is no character 1 in $s$.\n\nIn the seventh test case, the substring 3112 can be used. \n\n### Response:\n",

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Qpwoeirut has taken up architecture and ambitiously decided to remodel his city.\n\nQpwoeirut's city can be described as a row of $n$ buildings, the $i$-th ($1 \\le i \\le n$) of which is $h_i$ floors high. You can assume that the height of every floor in this problem is equal. Therefore, building $i$ is taller than the building $j$ if and only if the number of floors $h_i$ in building $i$ is larger than the number of floors $h_j$ in building $j$.\n\nBuilding $i$ is cool if it is taller than both building $i-1$ and building $i+1$ (and both of them exist). Note that neither the $1$-st nor the $n$-th building can be cool.\n\nTo remodel the city, Qpwoeirut needs to maximize the number of cool buildings. To do this, Qpwoeirut can build additional floors on top of any of the buildings to make them taller. Note that he cannot remove already existing floors.\n\nSince building new floors is expensive, Qpwoeirut wants to minimize the number of floors he builds. Find the minimum number of floors Qpwoeirut needs to build in order to maximize the number of cool buildings.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains the single integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the number of buildings in Qpwoeirut's city.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_n$ ($1 \\le h_i \\le 10^9$) \u2014 the number of floors in each of the buildings of the city.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of additional floors Qpwoeirut needs to build in order to maximize the number of cool buildings.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n6\n3\n2 1 2\n5\n1 2 1 4 3\n6\n3 1 4 5 5 2\n8\n4 2 1 3 5 3 6 1\n6\n1 10 1 1 10 1\n8\n1 10 11 1 10 11 10 1\nOutput\n2\n0\n3\n3\n0\n4\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, it is optimal for Qpwoeirut to make the second building cool by building $2$ additional floors on top of it, making it taller than both of its adjacent buildings. The final heights of buildings will be $[2, \\underline{3}, 2]$.\n\nIn the second test case, the number of cool buildings is already maximized, so Qpwoeirut does not need to do anything.\n\nIn the third test case, it is optimal for Qpwoeirut to make the third and fifth buildings cool by building $2$ additional floors onto the third building and $1$ additional floor onto the fifth building. The final heights of buildings will be $[3, 1, \\underline{6}, 5, \\underline{6}, 2]$.\n\nIt can be shown that it is impossible to make more than $2$ of the buildings cool, or to make $2$ buildings cool using fewer than $3$ additional floors.\n\nIn the fourth test case, Qpwoeirut can either make the second building cool, or he can make the third building cool. Either way, he will be building $3$ additional floors and maximizing the number of cool buildings. The final heights of buildings will be $[4, 2, \\underline{4}, 3, 5, 3, 6, 1]$ or $[4, \\underline{5}, 1, 3, 5, 3, 6, 1]$. \n\n### Response:\n",

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Raju is very much interested in winning money through lotteries. \nLottery Association is organising lottery matches quite frequently.\nA lottery match begins at certain time and ends at a certain time. Raju can buy ticket of certain match if he wants to bet in that match.\n\nBut according to Lottery Association, Raju can buy only tickets of those matches whose times don't conflict. \n\nNOTE: Suppose at match ends at t=T and another match begins at the same time, Raju can buy tickets of both the matches.\n\nRaju knows exactly his probability of winning a certain lottery. He wants to buy tickets in such a way that will maximize his expected number of wins. Print the maximal expected number of lotteries that Raju will win if he buys tickets of the optimal subset of non-conflicting lottery matches.\n\nInput:\n\nFirst line contains T, the number of testcases. Each testcase consists of integer N, the number of lottery matches going to take place. Each of the next N lines contain three space separated integers denoting start time (st), end time (et) and winning percentage (wp) of that match.\n\nOutput:\n\nPrint for each testcase per line, the maximal expected number of lotteries that Raju will win if he buys tickets of the optimal subset of non-conflicting lottery matches.

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: When Xellos was doing a practice course in university, he once had to measure the intensity of an effect that slowly approached equilibrium. A good way to determine the equilibrium intensity would be choosing a sufficiently large number of consecutive data points that seems as constant as possible and taking their average. Of course, with the usual sizes of data, it's nothing challenging \u2014 but why not make a similar programming contest problem while we're at it?\n\nYou're given a sequence of n data points a1, ..., an. There aren't any big jumps between consecutive data points \u2014 for each 1 \u2264 i < n, it's guaranteed that |ai + 1 - ai| \u2264 1.\n\nA range [l, r] of data points is said to be almost constant if the difference between the largest and the smallest value in that range is at most 1. Formally, let M be the maximum and m the minimum value of ai for l \u2264 i \u2264 r; the range [l, r] is almost constant if M - m \u2264 1.\n\nFind the length of the longest almost constant range.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100 000) \u2014 the number of data points.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 \u2264 ai \u2264 100 000).\n\nOutput\n\nPrint a single number \u2014 the maximum length of an almost constant range of the given sequence.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n5\n1 2 3 3 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n4\n\n\nInput\n\n11\n5 4 5 5 6 7 8 8 8 7 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n5\n\nNote\n\nIn the first sample, the longest almost constant range is [2, 5]; its length (the number of data points in it) is 4.\n\nIn the second sample, there are three almost constant ranges of length 4: [1, 4], [6, 9] and [7, 10]; the only almost constant range of the maximum length 5 is [6, 10]. \n\n### Response:\n",

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: \u0421ity N. has a huge problem with roads, food and IT-infrastructure. In total the city has n junctions, some pairs of them are connected by bidirectional roads. The road network consists of n - 1 roads, you can get from any junction to any other one by these roads. Yes, you're right \u2014 the road network forms an undirected tree.\n\nRecently, the Mayor came up with a way that eliminates the problems with the food and the IT-infrastructure at the same time! He decided to put at the city junctions restaurants of two well-known cafe networks for IT professionals: \"iMac D0naldz\" and \"Burger Bing\". Since the network owners are not friends, it is strictly prohibited to place two restaurants of different networks on neighboring junctions. There are other requirements. Here's the full list:\n\n  * each junction must have at most one restaurant; \n  * each restaurant belongs either to \"iMac D0naldz\", or to \"Burger Bing\"; \n  * each network should build at least one restaurant; \n  * there is no pair of junctions that are connected by a road and contains restaurants of different networks. \n\n\n\nThe Mayor is going to take a large tax from each restaurant, so he is interested in making the total number of the restaurants as large as possible.\n\nHelp the Mayor to analyze the situation. Find all such pairs of (a, b) that a restaurants can belong to \"iMac D0naldz\", b restaurants can belong to \"Burger Bing\", and the sum of a + b is as large as possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe first input line contains integer n (3 \u2264 n \u2264 5000) \u2014 the number of junctions in the city. Next n - 1 lines list all roads one per line. Each road is given as a pair of integers xi, yi (1 \u2264 xi, yi \u2264 n) \u2014 the indexes of connected junctions. Consider the junctions indexed from 1 to n.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the given road network is represented by an undirected tree with n vertexes.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint on the first line integer z \u2014 the number of sought pairs. Then print all sought pairs (a, b) in the order of increasing of the first component a.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n3\n1 3\n2 2\n3 1\n\n\nInput\n\n10\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n5 6\n6 7\n7 4\n8 9\n9 10\n10 4\n\n\nOutput\n\n6\n1 8\n2 7\n3 6\n6 3\n7 2\n8 1\n\nNote\n\nThe figure below shows the answers to the first test case.

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: We are interested in collecting the triples of positive integers ```(a, b, c)``` that fulfill the following equation:\n```python\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b3\n```\nThe first triple with the lowest values that satisfies the equation we have above is (2, 2 ,2).\nIn effect:\n```python\n2\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = 2\u00b3\n4  + 4  = 8\n```\nThe first pair of triples that \"shares\" the same value of ```c``` is: ```(2, 11, 5)``` and ```(5, 10, 5)```. \n\nBoth triples share the same value of ```c```  is ```c = 5```. \n```python\nTriple (2, 11, 5)                  Triple(5, 10, 5)\n2\u00b2 + 11\u00b2 =  5\u00b3                      5\u00b2 +  10\u00b2  =  5\u00b3\n4  + 121 = 125                     25  + 100   = 125\n```\nSo, we say that the value ```c``` has two solutions because there are two triples sharing the same value of ```c```.\n\nThere are some values of ```c``` with no solutions.\n\nThe first value of ```c``` that have a surprising number of solutions is ```65``` with ```8``` different triples.\n\nIn order to avoid duplications you will consider that ```a <= b``` always.\n\nMake the function ```find_abc_sumsqcube()```, that may give us the values of c for an specific number of solutions.\n\nFor that purpose the above required function will receive two arguments, ```c_max``` and ```num_sol```. It is understandable that ```c_max``` will give to our function the upper limit of ```c``` and ```num_sol```, the specific number of solutions.\n\nThe function will output a sorted list with the values of ```c``` that have a number of solutions equals to ```num_sol```\n\nLet's see some cases: \n```python\nfind_abc_sumsqcube(5, 1) == [2] # below or equal to c_max = 5 we have triple the (2, 2, 2) (see above)\n\nfind_abc_sumsqcube(5, 2) == [5] # now we want the values of ```c \u2264 c_max``` with two solutions (see above again)\n\nfind_abc_sumsqcube(10, 2) == [5, 10]\n\nfind_abc_sumsqcube(20, 8) == [] # There are no values of c equal and bellow 20 having 8 solutions.\n```\n\nOur tests will have the following ranges for our two arguments:\n```python\n5 \u2264 c_max \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 num_sol \u2264 10\n```\nHappy coding!! \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Limak is a little polar bear. Polar bears hate long strings and thus they like to compress them. You should also know that Limak is so young that he knows only first six letters of the English alphabet: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' and 'f'.\n\nYou are given a set of q possible operations. Limak can perform them in any order, any operation may be applied any number of times. The i-th operation is described by a string a_{i} of length two and a string b_{i} of length one. No two of q possible operations have the same string a_{i}.\n\nWhen Limak has a string s he can perform the i-th operation on s if the first two letters of s match a two-letter string a_{i}. Performing the i-th operation removes first two letters of s and inserts there a string b_{i}. See the notes section for further clarification.\n\nYou may note that performing an operation decreases the length of a string s exactly by 1. Also, for some sets of operations there may be a string that cannot be compressed any further, because the first two letters don't match any a_{i}.\n\nLimak wants to start with a string of length n and perform n - 1 operations to finally get a one-letter string \"a\". In how many ways can he choose the starting string to be able to get \"a\"? Remember that Limak can use only letters he knows.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and q (2 \u2264 n \u2264 6, 1 \u2264 q \u2264 36)\u00a0\u2014 the length of the initial string and the number of available operations.\n\nThe next q lines describe the possible operations. The i-th of them contains two strings a_{i} and b_{i} (|a_{i}| = 2, |b_{i}| = 1). It's guaranteed that a_{i} \u2260 a_{j} for i \u2260 j and that all a_{i} and b_{i} consist of only first six lowercase English letters.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the number of strings of length n that Limak will be able to transform to string \"a\" by applying only operations given in the input.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 5\nab a\ncc c\nca a\nee c\nff d\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n2 8\naf e\ndc d\ncc f\nbc b\nda b\neb a\nbb b\nff c\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n6 2\nbb a\nba a\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, we count initial strings of length 3 from which Limak can get a required string \"a\". There are 4 such strings: \"abb\", \"cab\", \"cca\", \"eea\". The first one Limak can compress using operation 1 two times (changing \"ab\" to a single \"a\"). The first operation would change \"abb\" to \"ab\" and the second operation would change \"ab\" to \"a\".\n\nOther three strings may be compressed as follows:   \"cab\" $\\rightarrow$ \"ab\" $\\rightarrow$ \"a\"  \"cca\" $\\rightarrow$ \"ca\" $\\rightarrow$ \"a\"  \"eea\" $\\rightarrow$ \"ca\" $\\rightarrow$ \"a\" \n\nIn the second sample, the only correct initial string is \"eb\" because it can be immediately compressed to \"a\". \n\n### Response:\n",

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: You are given a string $s[1 \\dots n]$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It is guaranteed that $n = 2^k$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$.\n\nThe string $s[1 \\dots n]$ is called $c$-good if at least one of the following three conditions is satisfied:  The length of $s$ is $1$, and it consists of the character $c$ (i.e. $s_1=c$); The length of $s$ is greater than $1$, the first half of the string consists of only the character $c$ (i.e. $s_1=s_2=\\dots=s_{\\frac{n}{2}}=c$) and the second half of the string (i.e. the string $s_{\\frac{n}{2} + 1}s_{\\frac{n}{2} + 2} \\dots s_n$) is a $(c+1)$-good string;  The length of $s$ is greater than $1$, the second half of the string consists of only the character $c$ (i.e. $s_{\\frac{n}{2} + 1}=s_{\\frac{n}{2} + 2}=\\dots=s_n=c$) and the first half of the string (i.e. the string $s_1s_2 \\dots s_{\\frac{n}{2}}$) is a $(c+1)$-good string. \n\nFor example: \"aabc\" is 'a'-good, \"ffgheeee\" is 'e'-good.\n\nIn one move, you can choose one index $i$ from $1$ to $n$ and replace $s_i$ with any lowercase Latin letter (any character from 'a' to 'z').\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain an 'a'-good string from $s$ (i.e. $c$-good string for $c=$ 'a'). It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.\n\nYou have to answer $t$ independent test cases.\n\nAnother example of an 'a'-good string is as follows. Consider the string $s = $\"cdbbaaaa\". It is an 'a'-good string, because:  the second half of the string (\"aaaa\") consists of only the character 'a';  the first half of the string (\"cdbb\") is 'b'-good string, because:   the second half of the string (\"bb\") consists of only the character 'b';  the first half of the string (\"cd\") is 'c'-good string, because:   the first half of the string (\"c\") consists of only the character 'c';  the second half of the string (\"d\") is 'd'-good string.   \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of the test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 131~072$) \u2014 the length of $s$. It is guaranteed that $n = 2^k$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$. The second line of the test case contains the string $s$ consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$ ($\\sum n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the answer \u2014 the minimum number of moves required to obtain an 'a'-good string from $s$ (i.e. $c$-good string with $c =$ 'a').

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Monocarp is playing a computer game. Now he wants to complete the first level of this game.\n\nA level is a rectangular grid of $2$ rows and $n$ columns. Monocarp controls a character, which starts in cell $(1, 1)$ \u2014 at the intersection of the $1$-st row and the $1$-st column.\n\nMonocarp's character can move from one cell to another in one step if the cells are adjacent by side and/or corner. Formally, it is possible to move from cell $(x_1, y_1)$ to cell $(x_2, y_2)$ in one step if $|x_1 - x_2| \\le 1$ and $|y_1 - y_2| \\le 1$. Obviously, it is prohibited to go outside the grid.\n\nThere are traps in some cells. If Monocarp's character finds himself in such a cell, he dies, and the game ends.\n\nTo complete a level, Monocarp's character should reach cell $(2, n)$ \u2014 at the intersection of row $2$ and column $n$.\n\nHelp Monocarp determine if it is possible to complete the level.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow. Each test case consists of three lines.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of columns.\n\nThe next two lines describe the level. The $i$-th of these lines describes the $i$-th line of the level \u2014 the line consists of the characters '0' and '1'. The character '0' corresponds to a safe cell, the character '1' corresponds to a trap cell.\n\nAdditional constraint on the input: cells $(1, 1)$ and $(2, n)$ are safe.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output YES if it is possible to complete the level, and NO otherwise.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n3\n000\n000\n4\n0011\n1100\n4\n0111\n1110\n6\n010101\n101010\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nNO\nYES\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the example from the statement.\n\nIn the first test case, one of the possible paths is $(1, 1) \\rightarrow (2, 2) \\rightarrow (2, 3)$.\n\nIn the second test case, one of the possible paths is $(1, 1) \\rightarrow (1, 2) \\rightarrow (2, 3) \\rightarrow (2, 4)$.\n\nIn the fourth test case, one of the possible paths is $(1, 1) \\rightarrow (2, 2) \\rightarrow (1, 3) \\rightarrow (2, 4) \\rightarrow (1, 5) \\rightarrow (2, 6)$. \n\n### Response:\n",

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: Samu's Birthday is near so she had started planning a party for all of her friends. Being a kind and caring girl she calls each of her friend and asks for his/her favorite dish.Now each friend has own liking/disliking for different dishes. \n\nA friend can only like or dislike a dish it means if we are having three dishes 1,2,3 then if a friend says that he likes Dishes 1 and 2 then its obvious that he dislikes Dish 3. So for each friend we are given a string of 1 and 0 where 1 shows that this person like this particular dish.\n\nNow we are given that Samu has N friends and total of K dishes available to make her menu.\nNow Samu doesn't want to make any of her friend unhappy , After all its her birthday.\n\nSo she got confused on what dishes to count in menu and calls you for help. You need to find count of minimum dishes to order so that all of her N friends are happy which means everyone has at least one dish to eat in party.\n\nNote : Its for sure that everyone has at least liking for one dish.\n\nInput : Input will contain T test cases and each of the test case has following description :\n\nFirst line of test case has N denoting the total number of friends and K denoting the total number of dishes available.Both separated by a space (Dishes are numbered from 1 to K) . \n\nThen it is followed by N lines each of length K . Each of the N lines contains a string of 0 and 1 where if j th (1 \u2264 j \u2264 K) value in i th line (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N) is set 1 then it shows that dish number j is liked by  that ith Samu's friend.\n\nOutput : You need to tell the minimum number of dishes to be taken in menu so that all friends are happy.\n\nConstraints :\n\n 1\u2264 T \u2264 10. \n\n 1 \u2264 N \u2264 500. \n\n 1 \u2264 K \u2264 10 \n\nEach string will only contain 0 or 1 and it is sure that their is at least one 1 in each string depicting like/dislike of Samu's friend\n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n1\n2 2\n10 \n01\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\n2\n\nExplanation\n\nBoth dishes are to be taken into account as Friend 1 don't like Dish 2 and Friend 2 don't like Dish 1. \n\n### Response:\n",

Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: ## TL;DR\n\nGiven a number of vertices `N` and a list of weighted directed edges in a directed acyclic graph (each edge is written as `[start, end, weight]` where `from < to`), compute the weight of the shortest path from vertex `0` to vertex `N - 1`.  If there is no such path, return `-1`.\n\n## Background\n\nA weighted DAG is a directed acyclic graph where each edge has a weight associated with it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n3\n1\n5\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\n\nIn this example, the shortest path from A to D is given by A -> B -> D, which has a total weight of 4.\n\nFinding shortest distances in DAGs is made easier by the fact that the nodes can be _linearized:_ they can be given an order `A1, A2, ..., An` such that edges only point forward (that is, there are no edges from `Aj` to `Ai` when `j > i`).  In the example above, the two possible linear orderings are `A, B, C, D` and `A, C, B, D.`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n1\n5\n5\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\n\n## Your Task\n\nGiven a number `N` (indicating a graph with vertices `0, 1, ..., N-1`) and a list of weighted edges `[start, end, weight]` for a DAG, where `start < end` for each edge, find the weight (a.k.a. length) of the shortest path from node `0` to node `N-1`.\n\nFor example, if the input is\n\n```\nN = 4\nedgeList = [\n  [0, 1, 1], [0, 2, 5], [0, 3, 5], [1, 3, 3], [2, 3, 1]\n]\n```\n\nthen we have the graph depicted above (with `0 = A`, `1 = B`, etc.) and the answer is `4`.\n\nIf there is no path from node `0` to node `N-1`, return `-1`.\n\n## Notes and Warnings\n\n**Precondition:** `N` will always be greater than 1, and edge weights will always be positive integers.  There may be multiple edges going between two nodes.\n\n**Warning:** You will probably need to use a dynamic programming solution if you want your solution to run fast enough not to time out--that's the whole point of this kata!\n\n\nHowever, a well-written general shortest-path algorithm such as Dijkstra's Algorithm may also be fast enough to past the soak tests.  (The reason is that the dividing line between linear and linearithmic time is hard to define and depends on a variety of external factors, so the kata's tests err on the safe side.) \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. Your program should use dynamic programming. \nQuestion: After overcoming the stairs Dasha came to classes. She needed to write a password to begin her classes. The password is a string of length n which satisfies the following requirements:  There is at least one digit in the string,  There is at least one lowercase (small) letter of the Latin alphabet in the string,  There is at least one of three listed symbols in the string: '#', '*', '&'.  [Image] \n\nConsidering that these are programming classes it is not easy to write the password.\n\nFor each character of the password we have a fixed string of length m, on each of these n strings there is a pointer on some character. The i-th character displayed on the screen is the pointed character in the i-th string. Initially, all pointers are on characters with indexes 1 in the corresponding strings (all positions are numbered starting from one).\n\nDuring one operation Dasha can move a pointer in one string one character to the left or to the right. Strings are cyclic, it means that when we move the pointer which is on the character with index 1 to the left, it moves to the character with the index m, and when we move it to the right from the position m it moves to the position 1.\n\nYou need to determine the minimum number of operations necessary to make the string displayed on the screen a valid password. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, m (3 \u2264 n \u2264 50, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 50) \u2014 the length of the password and the length of strings which are assigned to password symbols. \n\nEach of the next n lines contains the string which is assigned to the i-th symbol of the password string. Its length is m, it consists of digits, lowercase English letters, and characters '#', '*' or '&'.\n\nYou have such input data that you can always get a valid password.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer \u2014 the minimum number of operations which is necessary to make the string, which is displayed on the screen, a valid password. \n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 4\n1**2\na3*0\nc4**\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n5 5\n#*&#*\n*a1c&\n&q2w*\n#a3c#\n*&#*&\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test it is necessary to move the pointer of the third string to one left to get the optimal answer.  [Image] \n\nIn the second test one of possible algorithms will be:   to move the pointer of the second symbol once to the right.  to move the pointer of the third symbol twice to the right.
