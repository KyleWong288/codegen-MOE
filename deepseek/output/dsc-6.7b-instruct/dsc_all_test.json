For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: You are given a grid with $n$ rows and $m$ columns. We denote the square on the $i$-th ($1\\le i\\le n$) row and $j$-th ($1\\le j\\le m$) column by $(i, j)$ and the number there by $a_{ij}$. All numbers are equal to $1$ or to $-1$.\n\nYou start from the square $(1, 1)$ and can move one square down or one square to the right at a time. In the end, you want to end up at the square $(n, m)$.\n\nIs it possible to move in such a way so that the sum of the values written in all the visited cells (including $a_{11}$ and $a_{nm}$) is $0$?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\le n, m \\le 1000$)  \u2014 the size of the grid.\n\nEach of the following $n$ lines contains $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer on the $i$-th line is $a_{ij}$ ($a_{ij} = 1$ or $-1$)  \u2014 the element in the cell $(i, j)$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n\\cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print \"YES\" if there exists a path from the top left to the bottom right that adds up to $0$, and \"NO\" otherwise. You can output each letter in any case.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n5\n1 1\n1\n1 2\n1 -1\n1 4\n1 -1 1 -1\n3 4\n1 -1 -1 -1\n-1 1 1 -1\n1 1 1 -1\n3 4\n1 -1 1 1\n-1 1 -1 1\n1 -1 1 1\nOutput\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nOne possible path for the fourth test case is given in the picture in the statement. \n\n### Response:\n",
