He thought of a different situation where there are $26$ types of viruses, named \"aorona\", \"borona\", \"corona\", ..., \"zorona\".\n\nYou are given a string $S$ with length $N$. There are $N$ people (numbered $1$ through $N$) and for each valid $i$, the $i$-th person is infected by exactly one type of virus named $S_{i}$orona (i.e. \"corona\" with the first letter replaced by the $i$-th character of $S$).\n\nYou should answer $Q$ queries. In each query:\nYou are given an integer $C$ denoting the number of available *isolation centers*.\nEach isolation center has an infinite capacity, but with the restriction that two people infected with the same type of virus cannot stay in the same isolation center.\nThere is also a *pending queue* with an infinite capacity and there are no restrictions on which people can be in the pending queue.\nInitially, the isolation centers and pending queue are empty.\nEach of the $N$ people should be placed in either the pending queue or one of the isolation centers.\nSince Vinay is busy finding a vaccine, he asks Swapnil to find a way to place the people in the pending queue and isolation centers such that the number of people in the pending queue is the smallest possible.\nHelp Swapnil find the size of the pending queue in that case.\n\n------  Input ------\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.

So when Kuldeep invites them to a party, both Raghu and Sayan decide to play a game. The game is simple, both Raghu and Sayan will eat the dishes served at the party till they are full, and the one who eats maximum number of distinct dishes is the winner. However, both of them can only eat a dishes if they can finish it completely i.e. if Raghu can eat only 50 kCal in a day and has already eaten dishes worth 40 kCal, then he can't eat a dish with calorie value greater than 10 kCal. \nGiven that all the dishes served at the party are infinite in number, (Kuldeep doesn't want any of his friends to miss on any dish) represented by their calorie value(in kCal) and the amount of kCal Raghu and Sayan can eat in a day, your job is to find out who'll win, in case of a tie print \u201cTie\u201d (quotes for clarity).\n\nInput:\nFirst line contains number of test cases T.\nEach test case contains two lines.\nFirst line contains three integers A, B and N. \nwhere A and B is respectively the maximum amount of kCal Raghu and Sayan can eat per day, respectively and N is the number of dishes served at the party.\nNext line contains N integers where i^th integer is the amount of kCal i^th dish has.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case print \"Raghu Won\" (quotes for clarity) if Raghu wins else if print \"Sayan Won\" (quotes for clarity) if Sayan wins else print \"Tie\" (quotes for clarity) if both eat equal number of dishes.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10000\n1 \u2264 kCal value of each dish \u2264 100000\n1 \u2264 A, B \u2264 1000000000  \n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n3\n15 20 3\n10 5 4\n3 10 2\n4 7\n10 8 3\n4 5 5\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\nSayan Won\nSayan Won\nRaghu Won \n\n### Response:\n",

The only difference is that in this version $n = 1$.\n\nIn the cinema seats can be represented as the table with $n$ rows and $m$ columns. The rows are numbered with integers from $1$ to $n$. The seats in each row are numbered with consecutive integers from left to right: in the $k$-th row from $m (k - 1) + 1$ to $m k$ for all rows $1 \\le k \\le n$.\n\n$1$\n\n$2$\n\n$\\cdots$\n\n$m - 1$\n\n$m$\n\n$m + 1$\n\n$m + 2$\n\n$\\cdots$\n\n$2 m - 1$\n\n$2 m$\n\n$2m + 1$\n\n$2m + 2$\n\n$\\cdots$\n\n$3 m - 1$\n\n$3 m$\n\n$\\vdots$\n\n$\\vdots$\n\n$\\ddots$\n\n$\\vdots$\n\n$\\vdots$\n\n$m (n - 1) + 1$\n\n$m (n - 1) + 2$\n\n$\\cdots$\n\n$n m - 1$\n\n$n m$\n\nThe table with seats indices\n\nThere are $nm$ people who want to go to the cinema to watch a new film. They are numbered with integers from $1$ to $nm$. You should give exactly one seat to each person.\n\nIt is known, that in this cinema as lower seat index you have as better you can see everything happening on the screen. $i$-th person has the level of sight $a_i$. Let's define $s_i$ as the seat index, that will be given to $i$-th person. You want to give better places for people with lower sight levels, so for any two people $i$, $j$ such that $a_i < a_j$ it should be satisfied that $s_i < s_j$.\n\nAfter you will give seats to all people they will start coming to their seats. In the order from $1$ to $nm$, each person will enter the hall and sit in their seat. To get to their place, the person will go to their seat's row and start moving from the first seat in this row to theirs from left to right. While moving some places will be free, some will be occupied with people already seated. The inconvenience of the person is equal to the number of occupied seats he or she will go through.\n\nLet's consider an example: $m = 5$, the person has the seat $4$ in the first row, the seats $1$, $3$, $5$ in the first row are already occupied, the seats $2$ and $4$ are free. The inconvenience of this person will be $2$, because he will go through occupied seats $1$ and $3$.\n\nFind the minimal total inconvenience (the sum of inconveniences of all people), that is possible to have by giving places for all people (all conditions should be satisfied).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($n = 1$, $1 \\le m \\le 300$) \u2014 the number of rows and places in each row respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n \\cdot m$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n \\cdot m}$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the sight level of $i$-th person.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of $n \\cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print a single integer \u2014 the minimal total inconvenience that can be achieved.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n1 3\n1 2 3\n1 5\n2 1 5 3 3\n1 2\n2 1\n1 6\n2 3 2 1 1 1\nOutput\n3\n6\n0\n1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, there is a single way to arrange people, because all sight levels are distinct. The first person will sit on the first seat, the second person will sit on the second place, the third person will sit on the third place. So inconvenience of the first person will be $0$, inconvenience of the second person will be $1$ and inconvenience of the third person will be $2$. The total inconvenience is $0 + 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nIn the second test case, people should sit as follows: $s_1 = 2$, $s_2 = 1$, $s_3 = 5$, $s_4 = 4$, $s_5 = 3$.

If less than 0, then 255\n\n`/`: set selected cell data to 0\n\n`!`: add new data cell to the end of the array\n\nYou start with selector at `0` and one cell with a value of `0`. If selector goes out of bounds, assume 0 for that cell but do not add it to the memory. If a + or - is being made do not change the value of the assumed cell. It will always stay 0 unless it is added to the memory\n\nIn other words:\n\n```\ndata: start 0 end\nselector:   ^\ndata start 1 2 4 end\nselector:        ^\nAssume that cell is zero.\n```\n\nExamples:\nConsider the following program:\n\n```python\n'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/'\n```\n\nIt's output is this:\n\n```python\n'Hello World!'\n```\n\nThis is made just by using 1 data cell.\n\nExample using multiple data cells:\n\n```python\n'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>'\n```\n\nAnd it's output is still:\n\n```python\n'Hello World!'\n```\n\nA more efficient example:\n\n```python\n'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++**!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*<<*>>!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*<<<<*!>>>>>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*'\n```\n\nWhich still returns the classic:\n\n```python\n'Hello World!'\n```\n\nOther characters are ingnored and therefore can serve as comments.\n\nAfter you're done, fell free to make translations and to discuss this kata. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: Roy is trying to develop a widget that shows Trending Topics (similar to Facebook) on the home page of HackerEarth Academy. \nHe has gathered a list of N Topics (their IDs) and their popularity score (say z-score) from the database. Now z-score change everyday according to the following rules:\nWhen a topic is mentioned in a 'Post', its z-score is increased by 50.  \nA 'Like' on such a Post, increases the z-score by 5.  \nA 'Comment' increases z-score by 10.  \nA 'Share' causes an increment of 20.  \n\nNow the Trending Topics are decided according to the change in z-score. One with the highest increment comes on top and list follows.\nRoy seeks your help to write an algorithm to find the top 5 Trending Topics.\nIf change in z-score for any two topics is same, then rank them according to their ID (one with higher ID gets priority). It is guaranteed that IDs will be unique.  \n\nInput format:\nFirst line contains integer N\nN lines follow\nEach contains 6 space separated numbers representing Topic ID, current z-score - Z, Posts - P, Likes - L, Comments - C, Shares - S\n\nOutput format:\nPrint top 5 Topics each in a new line.\nEach line should contain two space separated integers, Topic ID and new z-score of the topic.  \n\nConstraints:\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^6 \n1 \u2264 ID \u2264 10^9   \n0 \u2264 Z, P, L, C, S \u2264 10^9  \n\nSample Test Explanation:\nNow sort them according to the change in z-score. Change in z-score for IDs 999, 1001, 1002, 1003 is 100, so sort them according to their ID (one with the higher ID gets priority). Similarly proceed further.\n\nAfter you get the top 5 list of Topic IDs according to the above criteria, find the new z-score from the table for each ID.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n8\n1003 100 4 0 0 0\n1002 200 6 0 0 0\n1001 300 8 0 0 0\n1004 100 3 0 0 0\n1005 200 3 0 0 0\n1006 300 5 0 0 0\n1007 100 3 0 0 0\n999 100 4 0 0 0SAMPLE OUTPUT\n1003 200\n1002 300\n1001 400\n999 200\n1007 150 \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: Matryoshka is a wooden toy in the form of a painted doll, inside which you can put a similar doll of a smaller size.\n\nA set of nesting dolls contains one or more nesting dolls, their sizes are consecutive positive integers. Thus, a set of nesting dolls is described by two numbers: $s$ \u2014 the size of a smallest nesting doll in a set and $m$ \u2014 the number of dolls in a set. In other words, the set contains sizes of $s, s + 1, \\dots, s + m - 1$ for some integer $s$ and $m$ ($s,m > 0$).\n\nYou had one or more sets of nesting dolls. Recently, you found that someone mixed all your sets in one and recorded a sequence of doll sizes \u2014 integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$.\n\nYou do not remember how many sets you had, so you want to find the minimum number of sets that you could initially have.\n\nFor example, if a given sequence is $a=[2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1]$. Initially, there could be $2$ sets:\n\nthe first set consisting of $4$ nesting dolls with sizes $[1, 2, 3, 4]$;\n\na second set consisting of $2$ nesting dolls with sizes $[2, 3]$.\n\nAccording to a given sequence of sizes of nesting dolls $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$, determine the minimum number of nesting dolls that can make this sequence.\n\nEach set is completely used, so all its nesting dolls are used.

The candies are numbered from left to right. The $i$-th candy has weight $w_i$. Alice and Bob eat candies.\n\nAlice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row).\n\nBob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\n\nOf course, if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa).\n\nThey want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies. What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 the number of candies on the table.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n$ ($1 \\leq w_i \\leq 10^4$) \u2014 the weights of candies from left to right.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total while satisfying the condition.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n3\n10 20 10\n6\n2 1 4 2 4 1\n5\n1 2 4 8 16\n9\n7 3 20 5 15 1 11 8 10\nOutput\n2\n6\n0\n7\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is $2$ because they eat two candies in total.\n\nFor the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight $7$) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight $7$). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is $6$ (because they eat six candies in total).\n\nFor the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is $0$.\n\nFor the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights $[7, 3, 20]$ and Bob will eat candies with weights $[10, 8, 11, 1]$, they each eat $30$ weight. There is no better partition so the answer is $7$. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: Ross and Rachel are on a date. Ross, being the super geek he is, takes Rachel to see dinosaur exhibits. \nEach dinosaur has a name and K attributes which are described by an ordered K-tuple ( A1, A2, A3,..., AK ). Each attribute Ai is an integer between 0 to L inclusive. Ross tells Rachel about N dinosaurs. For each dinosaur, he tells her its name and gives her the K-tuple describing its attributes.\nAfterwards, he wants to play a quiz with Rachel. He gives Rachel Q K-tuples and ask her which dinosaur they belongs to.\nAs Rachel loves Ross and doesn't want him to think she wasn't paying attention, she wants to answer all questions correctly. Help her in this task.\n\nInput:\nThe first line contains N, K, L and Q, the number of dinosaurs, the size of the K-tuple, the maximum value of any attribute and the number of questions that Ross asks.\nN lines follow. The next i^th line contains a string which is the name of the i^th dinosaur and K space separated integer which are the attributes for the i^th dinosaur.\nQ lines follow. The next i^th line contains K space separated integer denoting a K-tuple.\n\nOutput:\nFor each question, output the name of the dinosaur that the K-tuple belongs to.\nIt is also possible that Ross is asking a trick question and the tuple doesn't describe any dinosaur.

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: ###Introduction\n\nThe [I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching) (Yijing, or Book of Changes) is an ancient Chinese book of sixty-four hexagrams. \nA hexagram is a figure composed of six stacked horizontal lines, where each line is either Yang (an unbroken line) or Yin (a broken line):\n```\n---------    ---- ----    ---------    \n---- ----    ---- ----    ---------    \n---- ----    ---- ----    ---------    \n---------    ---- ----    ---- ----    \n---------    ---------    ---- ----    \n---- ----    ---- ----    ---------    \n```\nThe book is commonly used as an oracle. After asking it a question about one's present scenario,\neach line is determined by random methods to be Yang or Yin. The resulting hexagram is then interpreted by the querent as a symbol of their current situation, and how it might unfold.\n\nThis kata will consult the I Ching using the three coin method.\n\n###Instructions\n\nA coin is flipped three times and lands heads\nor tails. The three results are used to\ndetermine a line as being either:\n```\n3 tails          ----x----  Yin (Moving Line*)\n2 tails 1 heads  ---------  Yang\n1 tails 2 heads  ---- ----  Yin \n3 heads          ----o----  Yang (Moving Line*)\n\n*See bottom of description if curious.\n```\nThis process is repeated six times to determine\neach line of the hexagram. The results of these\noperations are then stored in a 2D Array like so:\nIn each array the first index will always be the number of the line ('one' is the bottom line, and 'six' the top), and the other three values will be the results of the coin flips that belong to that line as heads ('h') and tails ('t').\n\nWrite a function that will take a 2D Array like the above as argument and return its hexagram as a string. Each line of the hexagram should begin on a new line.\n\nshould return:\n```\n---------\n---------\n----x----\n----o----\n---- ----\n---- ----\n```\nYou are welcome to consult your new oracle program with a question before pressing submit. You can compare your result [here](http://www.ichingfortune.com/hexagrams.php). The last test case is random and can be used for your query.\n\n*[1] A Moving Line is a Yang line that will change\nto Yin or vice versa. The hexagram made by the coin\nthrows represents the querent's current situation,\nand the hexagram that results from changing its\nmoving lines represents their upcoming situation.* \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: Our AAA company is in need of some software to help with logistics: you will be given the width and height of a map, a list of x coordinates and a list of y coordinates of the supply points, starting to count from the top left corner of the map as 0.\n\nYour goal is to return a two dimensional array/list with every item having the value of the distance of the square itself from the closest supply point expressed as a simple integer.\n\nQuick examples:\n\n```python\nlogistic_map(3,3,[0],[0])\n#returns\n#[[0,1,2],\n# [1,2,3],\n# [2,3,4]]\nlogistic_map(5,2,[0,4],[0,0])\n#returns\n#[[0,1,2,1,0],\n# [1,2,3,2,1]]\n```\n\nRemember that our company is operating with trucks, not drones, so you can simply use Manhattan distance. If supply points are present, they are going to be within the boundaries of the map; if no supply point is present on the map, just return `None`/`nil`/`null` in every cell.\n\n```python\nlogistic_map(2,2,[],[])\n#returns\n#[[None,None],\n# [None,None]]\n```\n\n**Note:** this one is taken (and a bit complicated) from a problem a real world AAA company [whose name I won't tell here] used in their interview. It was done by a friend of mine. It is nothing that difficult and I assume it is their own version of the FizzBuzz problem, but consider candidates were given about 30 mins to solve it. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: Today is Vasya's birthday. On this special occasion, he has organized a party for all of his friends. These friends are enumerated by integers from 1 to N. Each of Vasya's friends has a Knowledge Level. In addition, each of them knows an arbitrary number of other people at the party. This friendship is bidirectional and transitive in nature, i.e if person A knows person B and person B knows person C, then we consider that person A knows person C. All these people who know each other come together and form a single group of friends.  \n\nNow, they decide to play a game. In this game, among all groups of friends, the one with the highest knowledge level within each group is elected to represent the group during the game. Let's call this person the leader of the group.  If there are multiple candidates to be the leader of a group, you can select any of them arbitrarily. The game is then played after selecting these leaders.\n\nNow, Vasya wants to find the number of distinct ways the game can be played. He finds this task too hard and wants you to help him. As this number can be large, print it Modulo 10^9+7.   \n\nInput Format:\n\nThe first line contains two integers N and M denoting the number of people Vasya has invited to the party and the number of relations between these people. The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the where the i^{th} integer denotes the knowledge level of person i. Each of the next M lines contains 2 space separated integers u and v denoting that person u knows person v and vice-versa.  \n\nOutput Format\n\nPrint the required answer on a single line. As the answer may be large, print it Modulo 10^9+7 \n\nConstraints\n\n 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5 \n\n 0 \u2264 M \u2264 10^5 \n\n 0 \u2264 A[i] \u2264 10^9  \n\n 1 \u2264 u,v \u2264 N   \n\n M \u2264 (N*(N-1))/2     \n\nNote:\n\nThere can be self loops, i.e edges from and to the same person and multple edges from one person to another. \n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n5 4\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\n1\n\nExplanation\n\nHere, all the people at the party know each other. Among this group the person with the highest knowledge is person 5. Hence, there is only one way. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: Misha hacked the Codeforces site. Then he decided to let all the users change their handles. A user can now change his handle any number of times. But each new handle must not be equal to any handle that is already used or that was used at some point.\n\nMisha has a list of handle change requests. After completing the requests he wants to understand the relation between the original and the new handles of the users. Help him to do that.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer q (1 \u2264 q \u2264 1000), the number of handle change requests.\n\nNext q lines contain the descriptions of the requests, one per line.\n\nEach query consists of two non-empty strings old and new, separated by a space. The strings consist of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters and digits. Strings old and new are distinct. The lengths of the strings do not exceed 20.\n\nThe requests are given chronologically. In other words, by the moment of a query there is a single person with handle old, and handle new is not used and has not been used by anyone.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line output the integer n \u2014 the number of users that changed their handles at least once.\n\nIn the next n lines print the mapping between the old and the new handles of the users. Each of them must contain two strings, old and new, separated by a space, meaning that before the user had handle old, and after all the requests are completed, his handle is new.

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: You are given a list of $n$ integers. You can perform the following operation: you choose an element $x$ from the list, erase $x$ from the list, and subtract the value of $x$ from all the remaining elements. Thus, in one operation, the length of the list is decreased by exactly $1$.\n\nGiven an integer $k$ ($k>0$), find if there is some sequence of $n-1$ operations such that, after applying the operations, the only remaining element of the list is equal to $k$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$), the number of integers in the list, and the target value, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the $n$ integers of the list $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($-10^9 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases is not greater that $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print YES if you can achieve $k$ with a sequence of $n-1$ operations. Otherwise, print NO.\n\nYou may print each letter in any case (for example, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" will all be recognized as a positive answer).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n4 5\n4 2 2 7\n5 4\n1 9 1 3 4\n2 17\n17 0\n2 17\n18 18\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example we have the list $\\{4, 2, 2, 7\\}$, and we have the target $k = 5$. One way to achieve it is the following: first we choose the third element, obtaining the list $\\{2, 0, 5\\}$. Next we choose the first element, obtaining the list $\\{-2, 3\\}$. Finally, we choose the first element, obtaining the list $\\{5\\}$. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: We are interested in collecting the triples of positive integers ```(a, b, c)``` that fulfill the following equation:\n```python\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b3\n```\nThe first triple with the lowest values that satisfies the equation we have above is (2, 2 ,2).\nIn effect:\n```python\n2\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 = 2\u00b3\n4  + 4  = 8\n```\nThe first pair of triples that \"shares\" the same value of ```c``` is: ```(2, 11, 5)``` and ```(5, 10, 5)```. \n\nBoth triples share the same value of ```c```  is ```c = 5```. \n```python\nTriple (2, 11, 5)                  Triple(5, 10, 5)\n2\u00b2 + 11\u00b2 =  5\u00b3                      5\u00b2 +  10\u00b2  =  5\u00b3\n4  + 121 = 125                     25  + 100   = 125\n```\nSo, we say that the value ```c``` has two solutions because there are two triples sharing the same value of ```c```.\n\nThere are some values of ```c``` with no solutions.\n\nThe first value of ```c``` that have a surprising number of solutions is ```65``` with ```8``` different triples.\n\nIn order to avoid duplications you will consider that ```a <= b``` always.\n\nMake the function ```find_abc_sumsqcube()```, that may give us the values of c for an specific number of solutions.\n\nFor that purpose the above required function will receive two arguments, ```c_max``` and ```num_sol```. It is understandable that ```c_max``` will give to our function the upper limit of ```c``` and ```num_sol```, the specific number of solutions.\n\nThe function will output a sorted list with the values of ```c``` that have a number of solutions equals to ```num_sol```\n\nLet's see some cases: \n```python\nfind_abc_sumsqcube(5, 1) == [2] # below or equal to c_max = 5 we have triple the (2, 2, 2) (see above)\n\nfind_abc_sumsqcube(5, 2) == [5] # now we want the values of ```c \u2264 c_max``` with two solutions (see above again)\n\nfind_abc_sumsqcube(10, 2) == [5, 10]\n\nfind_abc_sumsqcube(20, 8) == [] # There are no values of c equal and bellow 20 having 8 solutions.\n```\n\nOur tests will have the following ranges for our two arguments:\n```python\n5 \u2264 c_max \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 num_sol \u2264 10\n```\nHappy coding!! \n\n### Response:\n",

One day, he was playing with them. During the play, he arranged the balls into two rows both consisting of N number of balls. These two rows of balls are given to you in the form of strings X, Y. Both these string consist of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white colored ball and 'B' a black colored.\n\nOther than these two rows of balls, Akhil has an infinite supply of extra balls of each color. he wants to create another row of N balls, Z in such a way that the sum of hamming distance between X and Z, and hamming distance between Y and Z is maximized.\n\nHamming Distance between two strings X and Y is defined as the number of positions where the color of balls in row X differs from the row Y ball at that position. e.g. hamming distance between \"WBB\", \"BWB\" is 2, as at position 1 and 2, corresponding colors in the two strings differ..\n\nAs there can be multiple such arrangements of row Z, Akhil wants you to find the lexicographically smallest arrangement which will maximize the above value. \n\n------ Input ------ \n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows:\nFirst line of each test case will contain a string X denoting the arrangement of balls in first row\nSecond line will contain the string Y denoting the arrangement of balls in second row.\n\n------ Output ------ \n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the string of length N denoting the arrangement of colors of the balls belonging to row Z.\n\n------ Constraints ------ \n\n$1 \u2264 T \u2264 3$\n\n------ Subtasks ------ \n\nSubtask #1 (10 points) : 1 \u2264 N \u2264 16\nSubtask #2 (20 points) : 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^{3}\nSubtask #3 (70 points) : 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^{5}\n\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \n1\nWBWB\nWBBB\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \nBWBW\n----- explanation 1 ------ \nExample case 1.
