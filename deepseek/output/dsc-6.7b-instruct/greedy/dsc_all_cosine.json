The square in the $i$-th row from top and $j$-th column from the left is labelled $(i,j)$.\n\nCurrently, Gregor has some pawns in the $n$-th row. There are also enemy pawns in the $1$-st row. On one turn, Gregor moves one of his pawns. A pawn can move one square up (from $(i,j)$ to $(i-1,j)$) if there is no pawn in the destination square. Additionally, a pawn can move one square diagonally up (from $(i,j)$ to either $(i-1,j-1)$ or $(i-1,j+1)$) if and only if there is an enemy pawn in that square. The enemy pawn is also removed.\n\nGregor wants to know what is the maximum number of his pawns that can reach row $1$?\n\nNote that only Gregor takes turns in this game, and the enemy pawns never move. Also, when Gregor's pawn reaches row $1$, it is stuck and cannot make any further moves.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1\\le t\\le 2\\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.\n\nEach test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2\\le n\\le 2\\cdot{10}^{5}$) \u2014 the size of the chessboard.\n\nThe second line consists of a string of binary digits of length $n$, where a $1$ in the $i$-th position corresponds to an enemy pawn in the $i$-th cell from the left, and $0$ corresponds to an empty cell.\n\nThe third line consists of a string of binary digits of length $n$, where a $1$ in the $i$-th position corresponds to a Gregor's pawn in the $i$-th cell from the left, and $0$ corresponds to an empty cell.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases is less than $2\\cdot{10}^{5}$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of Gregor's pawns which can reach the $1$-st row.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n3\n000\n111\n4\n1111\n1111\n3\n010\n010\n5\n11001\n00000\nOutput\n3\n4\n0\n0\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, Gregor can simply advance all $3$ of his pawns forward. Thus, the answer is $3$.\n\nIn the second example, Gregor can guarantee that all $4$ of his pawns reach the enemy row, by following the colored paths as demonstrated in the diagram below. Remember, only Gregor takes turns in this \"game\"!\n\nIn the third example, Gregor's only pawn is stuck behind the enemy pawn, and cannot reach the end.\n\nIn the fourth example, Gregor has no pawns, so the answer is clearly $0$. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: Rahul and Tina are looking forward to starting their new year at college. As they enter their new classroom, they observe the seats of students are arranged in a $n \\times m$ grid. The seat in row $r$ and column $c$ is denoted by $(r, c)$, and the distance between two seats $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ is $|a-c| + |b-d|$.\n\nAs the class president, Tina has access to exactly $k$ buckets of pink paint. The following process occurs.\n\nFirst, Tina chooses exactly $k$ seats in the classroom to paint with pink paint. One bucket of paint can paint exactly one seat.\n\nAfter Tina has painted $k$ seats in the previous step, Rahul chooses where he sits. He will not choose a seat that has been painted pink due to his hatred of the colour pink.\n\nAfter Rahul has chosen his seat, Tina chooses a seat for herself. She can choose any of the seats, painted or not, other than the one chosen by Rahul.\n\nRahul wants to choose a seat such that he sits as close to Tina as possible. However, Tina wants to sit as far away from Rahul as possible due to some complicated relationship history that we couldn't fit into the statement!\n\nNow, Rahul wonders for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n \\cdot m - 1$, if Tina has $k$ buckets of paint, how close can Rahul sit to Tina, if both Rahul and Tina are aware of each other's intentions and they both act as strategically as possible? Please help satisfy Rahul's curiosity!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $m$ ($2 \\leq n \\cdot m \\leq 10^5$) \u2014 the number of rows and columns of seats in the classroom.\n\nThe sum of $n \\cdot m$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output $n \\cdot m$ ordered integers \u2014 the distance between Rahul and Tina if both of them act optimally for every $k \\in [0, n \\cdot m - 1]$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n2\n4 3\n1 2\nOutput\n3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 \n1 1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nOne possible sequence of choices for the first testcase where Tina has $k=3$ buckets of paints is as follows.\n\nTina paints the seats at positions $(1, 2)$, $(2, 2)$, $(3, 2)$ with pink paint. Rahul chooses the seat at $(3, 1)$ after which Tina chooses to sit at $(1, 3)$.\n\nTherefore, the distance between Tina and Rahul is $|3-1| + |1-3| = 4$, and we can prove that this is indeed the minimum possible distance under the given constraints. There may be other choices of seats which lead to the same answer as well.\n\nFor $k=0$ in the first test case, Rahul can decide to sit at $(2, 2)$ and Tina can decide to sit at $(4, 3)$ so the distance between them would be $|2 - 4| + |2 - 3| = 3$.\n\nBelow are pictorial representations of the $k=3$ and $k=0$ cases for the first test case.\n\nA possible seating arrangement for $k=3$.\n\nA possible seating arrangement for $k=0$. \n\n### Response:\n",

Your task is to paint each pebble using one of the k given colors so that for each color c and any two piles i and j the difference between the number of pebbles of color c in pile i and number of pebbles of color c in pile j is at most one.\n\nIn other words, let's say that b_{i}, c is the number of pebbles of color c in the i-th pile. Then for any 1 \u2264 c \u2264 k, 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n the following condition must be satisfied |b_{i}, c - b_{j}, c| \u2264 1. It isn't necessary to use all k colors: if color c hasn't been used in pile i, then b_{i}, c is considered to be zero.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains positive integers n and k (1 \u2264 n, k \u2264 100), separated by a space \u2014 the number of piles and the number of colors respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100) denoting number of pebbles in each of the piles.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is no way to paint the pebbles satisfying the given condition, output \"NO\" (without quotes) .\n\nOtherwise in the first line output \"YES\" (without quotes). Then n lines should follow, the i-th of them should contain a_{i} space-separated integers. j-th (1 \u2264 j \u2264 a_{i}) of these integers should be equal to the color of the j-th pebble in the i-th pile.

In spite of this loneliness, he doesn't lose heart, because he has business of national importance. For example, he has to pay an official visit to square t. As the king is not in habit of wasting his time, he wants to get from his current position s to square t in the least number of moves. Help him to do this.\n\n<image>\n\nIn one move the king can get to the square that has a common side or a common vertex with the square the king is currently in (generally there are 8 different squares he can move to).\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains the chessboard coordinates of square s, the second line \u2014 of square t.\n\nChessboard coordinates consist of two characters, the first one is a lowercase Latin letter (from a to h), the second one is a digit from 1 to 8.\n\nOutput\n\nIn the first line print n \u2014 minimum number of the king's moves. Then in n lines print the moves themselves. Each move is described with one of the 8: L, R, U, D, LU, LD, RU or RD. \n\nL, R, U, D stand respectively for moves left, right, up and down (according to the picture), and 2-letter combinations stand for diagonal moves.

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: Martians are actively engaged in interplanetary trade. Olymp City, the Martian city known for its spaceport, has become a place where goods from all the corners of our Galaxy come. To deliver even more freight from faraway planets, Martians need fast spaceships.\n\nA group of scientists conducts experiments to build a fast engine for the new spaceship. In the current experiment, there are $n$ elementary particles, the $i$-th of them has type $a_i$.\n\nDenote a subsegment of the particle sequence ($a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$) as a sequence ($a_l, a_{l+1}, \\dots, a_r$) for some left bound $l$ and right bound $r$ ($1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$). For instance, the sequence $(1\\ 4\\ 2\\ 8\\ 5\\ 7)$ for $l=2$ and $r=4$ has the sequence $(4\\ 2\\ 8)$ as a subsegment. Two subsegments are considered different if at least one bound of those subsegments differs.\n\nNote that the subsegments can be equal as sequences but still considered different. For example, consider the sequence $(1\\ 1\\ 1\\ 1\\ 1)$ and two of its subsegments: one with $l=1$ and $r=3$ and another with $l=2$ and $r=4$. Both subsegments are equal to $(1\\ 1\\ 1)$, but still considered different, as their left and right bounds differ.\n\nThe scientists want to conduct a reaction to get two different subsegments of the same length. Denote this length $k$. The resulting pair of subsegments must be harmonious, i. e. for some $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le k$) it must be true that the types of particles on the $i$-th position are the same for these two subsegments. For example, the pair $(1\\ 7\\ 3)$ and $(4\\ 7\\ 8)$ is harmonious, as both subsegments have $7$ on the second position. The pair $(1\\ 2\\ 3)$ and $(3\\ 1\\ 2)$ is not harmonious.\n\nThe longer are harmonious subsegments, the more chances for the scientists to design a fast engine. So, they asked you to calculate the maximal possible length of harmonious pair made of different subsegments.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The following are descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 150000$) \u2014 the amount of elementary particles in the sequence.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 150000$) \u2014 types of elementary particles.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3\\cdot10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test, print a single integer, maximal possible length of harmonious pair made of different subsegments. If such pair does not exist, print $-1$ instead.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n7\n3 1 5 2 1 3 4\n6\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n6\n1 4 2 8 5 7\n2\n15 15\nOutput\n4\n5\n-1\n1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first test case is shown on the picture below:\n\nAs you can see from it, you may choose the subsegments $(2\\ 1\\ 3\\ 4)$ and $(3\\ 1\\ 5\\ 2)$, which are a harmonious pair. Their length is equal to $4$, so the answer is $4$.\n\nIn the second test case, you need to take two subsegments: one with $l=1$ and $r=5$, and one with $l=2$ and $r=6$. It's not hard to observe that these segments are a harmonious pair and considered different even though they are both equal to $(1\\ 1\\ 1\\ 1\\ 1)$.\n\nIn the third test case, you cannot make a harmonious pair, so the answer is $-1$. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: Alyona has recently bought a miniature fridge that can be represented as a matrix with $h$ rows and $2$ columns. Initially there is only one shelf at the bottom of the fridge, but Alyona can install arbitrary number of shelves inside the fridge between any two rows. A shelf is two cells wide, does not occupy any space but separates the inside of the fridge to the lower and upper part.\n\n [Image] An example of a fridge with $h = 7$ and two shelves. The shelves are shown in black. The picture corresponds to the first example. \n\nAlyona has $n$ bottles of milk that she wants to put in the fridge. The $i$-th bottle is $a_i$ cells tall and $1$ cell wide. She can put a bottle on some shelf if the corresponding space above the shelf is at least as tall as the bottle. She can not put a bottle on top of another bottle (if there is no shelf between them). Two bottles can not share a cell.\n\nAlyona is interested in the largest integer $k$ such that she can put bottles $1$, $2$, ..., $k$ in the fridge at the same time. Find this largest $k$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $h$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^3$, $1 \\le h \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of bottles and the height of the fridge.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le h$)\u00a0\u2014 the heights of the bottles.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the single integer $k$\u00a0\u2014 the maximum integer such that Alyona can put the bottles $1$, $2$, ..., $k$ in the fridge at the same time. If Alyona can put all bottles in the fridge, print $n$. It is easy to see that Alyona can always put at least one bottle in the fridge.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 7\n2 3 5 4 1\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n10 10\n9 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n5 10\n3 1 4 2 4\n\nOutput\n5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nOne of optimal locations in the first example is shown on the picture in the statement.\n\nOne of optimal locations in the second example is shown on the picture below.\n\n [Image] \n\nOne of optimal locations in the third example is shown on the picture below.\n\n [Image] \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: There are $n$ people participating in some contest, they start participating in $x$ minutes intervals. That means the first participant starts at time $0$, the second participant starts at time $x$, the third \u2014 at time $2 \\cdot x$, and so on.\n\nDuration of contest is $t$ minutes for each participant, so the first participant finishes the contest at time $t$, the second \u2014 at time $t + x$, and so on. When a participant finishes the contest, their dissatisfaction equals to the number of participants that started the contest (or starting it now), but haven't yet finished it.\n\nDetermine the sum of dissatisfaction of all participants.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nEach of the next $k$ lines contains three integers $n$, $x$, $t$ ($1 \\le n, x, t \\le 2 \\cdot 10^9$) \u2014 the number of participants, the start interval and the contest duration.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $k$ lines, in the $i$-th line print the total dissatisfaction of participants in the $i$-th test case.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n4 2 5\n3 1 2\n3 3 10\n2000000000 1 2000000000\nOutput\n5\n3\n3\n1999999999000000000\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the first participant starts at $0$ and finishes at time $5$. By that time the second and the third participants start, so the dissatisfaction of the first participant is $2$.\n\nThe second participant starts at time $2$ and finishes at time $7$. By that time the third the fourth participants start, so the dissatisfaction of the second participant is $2$.\n\nThe third participant starts at $4$ and finishes at $9$. By that time the fourth participant starts, so the dissatisfaction of the third participant is $1$.\n\nThe fourth participant starts at $6$ and finishes at $11$. By time $11$ everyone finishes the contest, so the dissatisfaction of the fourth participant is $0$.\n\nIn the second example the first participant starts at $0$ and finishes at time $2$. By that time the second participants starts, and the third starts at exactly time $2$. So the dissatisfaction of the first participant is $2$.\n\nThe second participant starts at time $1$ and finishes at time $3$. At that time the third participant is solving the contest. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: You have $n$ distinct points $(x_1, y_1),\\ldots,(x_n,y_n)$ on the plane and a non-negative integer parameter $k$. Each point is a microscopic steel ball and $k$ is the attract power of a ball when it's charged. The attract power is the same for all balls.\n\nIn one operation, you can select a ball $i$ to charge it. Once charged, all balls with Manhattan distance at most $k$ from ball $i$ move to the position of ball $i$. Many balls may have the same coordinate after an operation.\n\nMore formally, for all balls $j$ such that $|x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j| \\le k$, we assign $x_j:=x_i$ and $y_j:=y_i$.\n\nAn example of an operation. After charging the ball in the center, two other balls move to its position. On the right side, the red dot in the center is the common position of those balls.\n\nYour task is to find the minimum number of operations to move all balls to the same position, or report that this is impossible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $k$ ($2 \\le n \\le 100$, $0 \\le k \\le 10^6$) \u2014 the number of balls and the attract power of all balls, respectively.\n\nThe following $n$ lines describe the balls' coordinates. The $i$-th of these lines contains two integers $x_i$, $y_i$ ($0 \\le x_i, y_i \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the coordinates of the $i$-th ball.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all points are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of operations to move all balls to the same position, or $-1$ if it is impossible.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n3\n3 2\n0 0\n3 3\n1 1\n3 3\n6 7\n8 8\n6 9\n4 1\n0 0\n0 1\n0 2\n0 3\nOutput\n-1\n1\n-1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, there are three balls at $(0, 0)$, $(3, 3)$, and $(1, 1)$ and the attract power is $2$. It is possible to move two balls together with one operation, but not all three balls together with any number of operations.\n\nIn the second test case, there are three balls at $(6, 7)$, $(8, 8)$, and $(6, 9)$ and the attract power is $3$. If we charge any ball, the other two will move to the same position, so we only require one operation.\n\nIn the third test case, there are four balls at $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, $(0, 2)$, and $(0, 3)$, and the attract power is $1$. We can show that it is impossible to move all balls to the same position with a sequence of operations. \n\n### Response:\n",

You forgot them, but you remembered a shuffled list containing all divisors of $x$ (including $1$ and $x$) and all divisors of $y$ (including $1$ and $y$). If $d$ is a divisor of both numbers $x$ and $y$ at the same time, there are two occurrences of $d$ in the list.\n\nFor example, if $x=4$ and $y=6$ then the given list can be any permutation of the list $[1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 6]$.

She initially has $n$ magical tokens. Their magical power can be represented with positive integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$.\n\nPatchouli may perform the following two operations on the tokens.\n\nFusion: Patchouli chooses two tokens, removes them, and creates a new token with magical power equal to the sum of the two chosen tokens.\n\nReduction: Patchouli chooses a token with an even value of magical power $x$, removes it and creates a new token with magical power equal to $\\frac{x}{2}$.\n\nTokens are more effective when their magical powers are odd values. Please help Patchouli to find the minimum number of operations she needs to make magical powers of all tokens odd values.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nFor each test case, the first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the initial number of tokens.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ intergers $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$) \u2014 the initial magical power of the $n$ tokens.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of operations Patchouli needs to make all tokens have an odd value of magical power.\n\nIt can be shown that under such restrictions the required sequence of operations exists.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n2\n1 9\n3\n1 1 2\n3\n2 4 8\n3\n1049600 33792 1280\nOutput\n0\n1\n3\n10\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nTest case 1:\n\n$a$ consists solely of odd numbers initially.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nChoose the tokens with magical power of $1$ and $2$ and perform Fusion. Now $a=[1,3]$, both are odd numbers.\n\nTest case 3:\n\nChoose the tokens with magical power of $2$ and $8$ and perform Fusion. Now $a=[4,10]$.\n\nChoose the token with magical power of $10$ and perform Reduction. Now $a=[4,5]$.\n\nChoose the tokens with magical power of $4$ and $5$ and perform Fusion. Now $a=[9]$, and $9$ is an odd number.\n\nIt can be shown that you can not make all the magical powers odd numbers in less than $3$ moves, so the answer is $3$. \n\n### Response:\n",

You can perform operations on it.\n\nIn one operation you can replace any element of the array $a_i$ with $\\lfloor \\frac{a_i}{2} \\rfloor$, that is, by an integer part of dividing $a_i$ by $2$ (rounding down).\n\nSee if you can apply the operation some number of times (possible $0$) to make the array $a$ become a permutation of numbers from $1$ to $n$ \u2014that is, so that it contains all numbers from $1$ to $n$, each exactly once.\n\nFor example, if $a = [1, 8, 25, 2]$, $n = 4$, then the answer is yes. You could do the following:\n\nReplace $8$ with $\\lfloor \\frac{8}{2} \\rfloor = 4$, then $a = [1, 4, 25, 2]$.\n\nReplace $25$ with $\\lfloor \\frac{25}{2} \\rfloor = 12$, then $a = [1, 4, 12, 2]$.\n\nReplace $12$ with $\\lfloor \\frac{12}{2} \\rfloor = 6$, then $a = [1, 4, 6, 2]$.\n\nReplace $6$ with $\\lfloor \\frac{6}{2} \\rfloor = 3$, then $a = [1, 4, 3, 2]$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input data contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014the number of test cases.\n\nEach test case contains exactly two lines.

The only difference is that in this version $n = 1$.\n\nIn the cinema seats can be represented as the table with $n$ rows and $m$ columns. The rows are numbered with integers from $1$ to $n$. The seats in each row are numbered with consecutive integers from left to right: in the $k$-th row from $m (k - 1) + 1$ to $m k$ for all rows $1 \\le k \\le n$.\n\n$1$\n\n$2$\n\n$\\cdots$\n\n$m - 1$\n\n$m$\n\n$m + 1$\n\n$m + 2$\n\n$\\cdots$\n\n$2 m - 1$\n\n$2 m$\n\n$2m + 1$\n\n$2m + 2$\n\n$\\cdots$\n\n$3 m - 1$\n\n$3 m$\n\n$\\vdots$\n\n$\\vdots$\n\n$\\ddots$\n\n$\\vdots$\n\n$\\vdots$\n\n$m (n - 1) + 1$\n\n$m (n - 1) + 2$\n\n$\\cdots$\n\n$n m - 1$\n\n$n m$\n\nThe table with seats indices\n\nThere are $nm$ people who want to go to the cinema to watch a new film. They are numbered with integers from $1$ to $nm$. You should give exactly one seat to each person.\n\nIt is known, that in this cinema as lower seat index you have as better you can see everything happening on the screen. $i$-th person has the level of sight $a_i$. Let's define $s_i$ as the seat index, that will be given to $i$-th person. You want to give better places for people with lower sight levels, so for any two people $i$, $j$ such that $a_i < a_j$ it should be satisfied that $s_i < s_j$.\n\nAfter you will give seats to all people they will start coming to their seats. In the order from $1$ to $nm$, each person will enter the hall and sit in their seat. To get to their place, the person will go to their seat's row and start moving from the first seat in this row to theirs from left to right. While moving some places will be free, some will be occupied with people already seated. The inconvenience of the person is equal to the number of occupied seats he or she will go through.\n\nLet's consider an example: $m = 5$, the person has the seat $4$ in the first row, the seats $1$, $3$, $5$ in the first row are already occupied, the seats $2$ and $4$ are free. The inconvenience of this person will be $2$, because he will go through occupied seats $1$ and $3$.\n\nFind the minimal total inconvenience (the sum of inconveniences of all people), that is possible to have by giving places for all people (all conditions should be satisfied).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($n = 1$, $1 \\le m \\le 300$) \u2014 the number of rows and places in each row respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n \\cdot m$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n \\cdot m}$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the sight level of $i$-th person.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of $n \\cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print a single integer \u2014 the minimal total inconvenience that can be achieved.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n1 3\n1 2 3\n1 5\n2 1 5 3 3\n1 2\n2 1\n1 6\n2 3 2 1 1 1\nOutput\n3\n6\n0\n1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, there is a single way to arrange people, because all sight levels are distinct. The first person will sit on the first seat, the second person will sit on the second place, the third person will sit on the third place. So inconvenience of the first person will be $0$, inconvenience of the second person will be $1$ and inconvenience of the third person will be $2$. The total inconvenience is $0 + 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nIn the second test case, people should sit as follows: $s_1 = 2$, $s_2 = 1$, $s_3 = 5$, $s_4 = 4$, $s_5 = 3$. The total inconvenience will be $6$. \n\n### Response:\n",

Too many times it happened that Vasya forgot to dispose of garbage and his apartment stank afterwards. Now he wants to create a garbage disposal plan and stick to it.\n\nFor each of next $n$ days Vasya knows $a_i$ \u2014 number of units of garbage he will produce on the $i$-th day. Each unit of garbage must be disposed of either on the day it was produced or on the next day. Vasya disposes of garbage by putting it inside a bag and dropping the bag into a garbage container. Each bag can contain up to $k$ units of garbage. It is allowed to compose and drop multiple bags into a garbage container in a single day.\n\nBeing economical, Vasya wants to use as few bags as possible. You are to compute the minimum number of bags Vasya needs to dispose of all of his garbage for the given $n$ days. No garbage should be left after the $n$-th day.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2\\cdot10^5, 1 \\le k \\le 10^9$) \u2014 number of days to consider and bag's capacity.

To do that Raze and Breach decided to play $t$ matches of a digit game...\n\nIn each of $t$ matches of the digit game, a positive integer is generated. It consists of $n$ digits. The digits of this integer are numerated from $1$ to $n$ from the highest-order digit to the lowest-order digit. After this integer is announced, the match starts.\n\nAgents play in turns. Raze starts. In one turn an agent can choose any unmarked digit and mark it. Raze can choose digits on odd positions, but can not choose digits on even positions. Breach can choose digits on even positions, but can not choose digits on odd positions. The match ends, when there is only one unmarked digit left. If the single last digit is odd, then Raze wins, else Breach wins.\n\nIt can be proved, that before the end of the match (for every initial integer with $n$ digits) each agent has an ability to make a turn, i.e. there is at least one unmarked digit, that stands on a position of required parity.\n\nFor each of $t$ matches find out, which agent wins, if both of them want to win and play optimally.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of input contains an integer $t$ $(1 \\le t \\le 100)$ \u00a0\u2014 the number of matches.\n\nThe first line of each match description contains an integer $n$ $(1 \\le n \\le 10^3)$ \u00a0\u2014 the number of digits of the generated number.\n\nThe second line of each match description contains an $n$-digit positive integer without leading zeros.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each match print $1$, if Raze wins, and $2$, if Breach wins.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n1\n2\n1\n3\n3\n102\n4\n2069\n\nOutput\n2\n1\n1\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first match no one can make a turn, the only digit left is $2$, it's even, so Breach wins.\n\nIn the second match the only digit left is $3$, it's odd, so Raze wins.\n\nIn the third match Raze can mark the last digit, after that Breach can only mark $0$. $1$ will be the last digit left, it's odd, so Raze wins.\n\nIn the fourth match no matter how Raze plays, Breach can mark $9$, and in the end there will be digit $0$.

He painted the elements into two colors, red and blue; $n$ elements were painted red, all other $m$ elements were painted blue.\n\nAfter painting the elements, he has written two sequences $r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_m$. The sequence $r$ consisted of all red elements of $a$ in the order they appeared in $a$; similarly, the sequence $b$ consisted of all blue elements of $a$ in the order they appeared in $a$ as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the original sequence was lost, and Monocarp only has the sequences $r$ and $b$. He wants to restore the original sequence. In case there are multiple ways to restore it, he wants to choose a way to restore that maximizes the value of\n\n$$f(a) = \\max(0, a_1, (a_1 + a_2), (a_1 + a_2 + a_3), \\dots, (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \\dots + a_{n + m}))$$\n\nHelp Monocarp to calculate the maximum possible value of $f(a)$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) \u2014 the number of test cases.

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: There are $n$ students in the first grade of Nlogonia high school. The principal wishes to split the students into two classrooms (each student must be in exactly one of the classrooms). Two distinct students whose name starts with the same letter will be chatty if they are put in the same classroom (because they must have a lot in common). Let $x$ be the number of such pairs of students in a split. Pairs $(a, b)$ and $(b, a)$ are the same and counted only once.\n\nFor example, if there are $6$ students: \"olivia\", \"jacob\", \"tanya\", \"jack\", \"oliver\" and \"jessica\", then:  splitting into two classrooms (\"jack\", \"jacob\", \"jessica\", \"tanya\") and (\"olivia\", \"oliver\") will give $x=4$ ($3$ chatting pairs in the first classroom, $1$ chatting pair in the second classroom),  splitting into two classrooms (\"jack\", \"tanya\", \"olivia\") and (\"jessica\", \"oliver\", \"jacob\") will give $x=1$ ($0$ chatting pairs in the first classroom, $1$ chatting pair in the second classroom). \n\nYou are given the list of the $n$ names. What is the minimum $x$ we can obtain by splitting the students into classrooms?\n\nNote that it is valid to place all of the students in one of the classrooms, leaving the other one empty.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1\\leq n \\leq 100$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of students.\n\nAfter this $n$ lines follow.\n\nThe $i$-th line contains the name of the $i$-th student.\n\nIt is guaranteed each name is a string of lowercase English letters of length at most $20$. Note that multiple students may share the same name.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe output must consist of a single integer $x$\u00a0\u2014 the minimum possible number of chatty pairs.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\njorge\njose\noscar\njerry\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n7\nkambei\ngorobei\nshichiroji\nkyuzo\nheihachi\nkatsushiro\nkikuchiyo\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n5\nmike\nmike\nmike\nmike\nmike\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample the minimum number of pairs is $1$. This can be achieved, for example, by putting everyone except jose in one classroom, and jose in the other, so jorge and jerry form the only chatty pair.\n\nIn the second sample the minimum number of pairs is $2$. This can be achieved, for example, by putting kambei, gorobei, shichiroji and kyuzo in one room and putting heihachi, katsushiro and kikuchiyo in the other room. In this case the two pairs are kambei and kyuzo, and katsushiro and kikuchiyo.\n\nIn the third sample the minimum number of pairs is $4$. This can be achieved by placing three of the students named mike in one classroom and the other two students in another classroom. Thus there will be three chatty pairs in one classroom and one chatty pair in the other classroom. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: You are playing a new famous fighting game: Kortal Mombat XII. You have to perform a brutality on your opponent's character.\n\nYou are playing the game on the new generation console so your gamepad have $26$ buttons. Each button has a single lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' written on it. All the letters on buttons are pairwise distinct.\n\nYou are given a sequence of hits, the $i$-th hit deals $a_i$ units of damage to the opponent's character. To perform the $i$-th hit you have to press the button $s_i$ on your gamepad. Hits are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\n\nYou know that if you press some button more than $k$ times in a row then it'll break. You cherish your gamepad and don't want to break any of its buttons.\n\nTo perform a brutality you have to land some of the hits of the given sequence. You are allowed to skip any of them, however changing the initial order of the sequence is prohibited. The total damage dealt is the sum of $a_i$ over all $i$ for the hits which weren't skipped.\n\nNote that if you skip the hit then the counter of consecutive presses the button won't reset.\n\nYour task is to skip some hits to deal the maximum possible total damage to the opponent's character and not break your gamepad buttons.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of hits and the maximum number of times you can push the same button in a row.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the damage of the $i$-th hit.\n\nThe third line of the input contains the string $s$ consisting of exactly $n$ lowercase Latin letters \u2014 the sequence of hits (each character is the letter on the button you need to press to perform the corresponding hit).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer $dmg$ \u2014 the maximum possible damage to the opponent's character you can deal without breaking your gamepad buttons.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 3\n1 5 16 18 7 2 10\nbaaaaca\n\nOutput\n54\n\nInput\n5 5\n2 4 1 3 1000\naaaaa\n\nOutput\n1010\n\nInput\n5 4\n2 4 1 3 1000\naaaaa\n\nOutput\n1009\n\nInput\n8 1\n10 15 2 1 4 8 15 16\nqqwweerr\n\nOutput\n41\n\nInput\n6 3\n14 18 9 19 2 15\ncccccc\n\nOutput\n52\n\nInput\n2 1\n10 10\nqq\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example you can choose hits with numbers $[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$ with the total damage $1 + 16 + 18 + 7 + 2 + 10 = 54$.\n\nIn the second example you can choose all hits so the total damage is $2 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 1000 = 1010$.\n\nIn the third example you can choose all hits expect the third one so the total damage is $2 + 4 + 3 + 1000 = 1009$.\n\nIn the fourth example you can choose hits with numbers $[2, 3, 6, 8]$. Only this way you can reach the maximum total damage $15 + 2 + 8 + 16 = 41$.\n\nIn the fifth example you can choose only hits with numbers $[2, 4, 6]$ with the total damage $18 + 19 + 15 = 52$.\n\nIn the sixth example you can change either first hit or the second hit (it does not matter) with the total damage $10$. \n\n### Response:\n",

Thus, a set of nesting dolls is described by two numbers: $s$ \u2014 the size of a smallest nesting doll in a set and $m$ \u2014 the number of dolls in a set. In other words, the set contains sizes of $s, s + 1, \\dots, s + m - 1$ for some integer $s$ and $m$ ($s,m > 0$).\n\nYou had one or more sets of nesting dolls. Recently, you found that someone mixed all your sets in one and recorded a sequence of doll sizes \u2014 integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$.\n\nYou do not remember how many sets you had, so you want to find the minimum number of sets that you could initially have.\n\nFor example, if a given sequence is $a=[2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1]$. Initially, there could be $2$ sets:\n\nthe first set consisting of $4$ nesting dolls with sizes $[1, 2, 3, 4]$;\n\na second set consisting of $2$ nesting dolls with sizes $[2, 3]$.\n\nAccording to a given sequence of sizes of nesting dolls $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$, determine the minimum number of nesting dolls that can make this sequence.\n\nEach set is completely used, so all its nesting dolls are used. Each element of a given sequence must correspond to exactly one doll from some set.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input data contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the total number of matryoshkas that were in all sets.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$)  \u2014 the sizes of the matryoshkas.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of values of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print one integer $k$ \u2014 the minimum possible number of matryoshkas sets.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n10\n6\n2 2 3 4 3 1\n5\n11 8 7 10 9\n6\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n8\n1 1 4 4 2 3 2 3\n6\n1 2 3 2 3 4\n7\n10 11 11 12 12 13 13\n7\n8 8 9 9 10 10 11\n8\n4 14 5 15 6 16 7 17\n8\n5 15 6 14 8 12 9 11\n5\n4 2 2 3 4\nOutput\n2\n1\n6\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n4\n3\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first test case is described in the problem statement.\n\nIn the second test case, all matryoshkas could be part of the same set with minimum size $s=7$.\n\nIn the third test case, each matryoshka represents a separate set. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: There are $n$ candies put from left to right on a table. The candies are numbered from left to right. The $i$-th candy has weight $w_i$. Alice and Bob eat candies.\n\nAlice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row).\n\nBob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\n\nOf course, if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa).\n\nThey want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies. What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 the number of candies on the table.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n$ ($1 \\leq w_i \\leq 10^4$) \u2014 the weights of candies from left to right.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total while satisfying the condition.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n3\n10 20 10\n6\n2 1 4 2 4 1\n5\n1 2 4 8 16\n9\n7 3 20 5 15 1 11 8 10\nOutput\n2\n6\n0\n7\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is $2$ because they eat two candies in total.\n\nFor the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight $7$) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight $7$). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is $6$ (because they eat six candies in total).\n\nFor the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is $0$.\n\nFor the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights $[7, 3, 20]$ and Bob will eat candies with weights $[10, 8, 11, 1]$, they each eat $30$ weight. There is no better partition so the answer is $7$. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: Consider a conveyor belt represented using a grid consisting of $n$ rows and $m$ columns. The cell in the $i$-th row from the top and the $j$-th column from the left is labelled $(i,j)$. \n\nEvery cell, except $(n,m)$, has a direction R (Right) or D (Down) assigned to it. If the cell $(i,j)$ is assigned direction R, any luggage kept on that will move to the cell $(i,j+1)$. Similarly, if the cell $(i,j)$ is assigned direction D, any luggage kept on that will move to the cell $(i+1,j)$. If at any moment, the luggage moves out of the grid, it is considered to be lost. \n\nThere is a counter at the cell $(n,m)$ from where all luggage is picked. A conveyor belt is called functional if and only if any luggage reaches the counter regardless of which cell it is placed in initially. More formally, for every cell $(i,j)$, any luggage placed in this cell should eventually end up in the cell $(n,m)$. \n\nThis may not hold initially; you are, however, allowed to change the directions of some cells to make the conveyor belt functional. Please determine the minimum amount of cells you have to change.\n\nPlease note that it is always possible to make any conveyor belt functional by changing the directions of some set of cells.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10$). Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n, m$ ($1 \\le n \\le 100$, $1 \\le m \\le 100$) \u00a0\u2014 the number of rows and columns, respectively.\n\nThe following $n$ lines each contain $m$ characters. The $j$-th character in the $i$-th line, $a_{i,j}$ is the initial direction of the cell $(i, j)$. Please note that $a_{n,m}=$ C.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each case, output in a new line the minimum number of cells that you have to change to make the conveyor belt functional. \n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n3 3\nRRD\nDDR\nRRC\n1 4\nDDDC\n6 9\nRDDDDDRRR\nRRDDRRDDD\nRRDRDRRDR\nDDDDRDDRR\nDRRDRDDDR\nDDRDRRDDC\n1 1\nC\n\nOutput\n1\n3\n9\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first case, just changing the direction of $(2,3)$ to D is enough.\n\nYou can verify that the resulting belt is functional. For example, if we place any luggage at $(2,2)$, it first moves to $(3,2)$ and then to $(3,3)$. \n\nIn the second case, we have no option but to change the first $3$ cells from D to R making the grid equal to RRRC. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array). There are $n! = n \\cdot (n-1) \\cdot (n - 2) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 1$ different permutations of length $n$.\n\nGiven a permutation $p$ of $n$ numbers, we create an array $a$ consisting of $2n$ numbers, which is equal to $p$ concatenated with its reverse. We then define the beauty of $p$ as the number of inversions in $a$.\n\nThe number of inversions in the array $a$ is the number of pairs of indices $i$, $j$ such that $i < j$ and $a_i > a_j$.\n\nFor example, for permutation $p = [1, 2]$, $a$ would be $[1, 2, 2, 1]$. The inversions in $a$ are $(2, 4)$ and $(3, 4)$ (assuming 1-based indexing). Hence, the beauty of $p$ is $2$.\n\nYour task is to find the sum of beauties of all $n!$ permutations of size $n$. Print the remainder we get when dividing this value by $1000000\\,007$ ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^5$). The description of the test cases follows.\n\nEach test case has only one line \u2014 the integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print one integer \u2014 the sum of beauties of all permutations of size $n$ modulo $1000000\\,007$ ($10^9 + 7$).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n3\n1\n2\n100\nOutput\n0\n4\n389456655\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first test case of the example, $p = [1]$ is the only permutation. $a = [1, 1]$ has $0$ inversions.\n\nFor the second test case of the example, the permutations are $[1, 2]$ and $[2, 1]$. Their respective $a$ arrays are $[1, 2, 2, 1]$ and $[2, 1, 1, 2]$, both of which have $2$ inversions. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: Young wilderness explorers set off to their first expedition led by senior explorer Russell. Explorers went into a forest, set up a camp and decided to split into groups to explore as much interesting locations as possible. Russell was trying to form groups, but ran into some difficulties...\n\nMost of the young explorers are inexperienced, and sending them alone would be a mistake. Even Russell himself became senior explorer not long ago. Each of young explorers has a positive integer parameter $e_i$\u00a0\u2014 his inexperience. Russell decided that an explorer with inexperience $e$ can only join the group of $e$ or more people.\n\nNow Russell needs to figure out how many groups he can organize. It's not necessary to include every explorer in one of the groups: some can stay in the camp. Russell is worried about this expedition, so he asked you to help him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the number of independent test cases $T$($1 \\leq T \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$). Next $2T$ lines contain description of test cases.\n\nThe first line of description of each test case contains the number of young explorers $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line contains $N$ integers $e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_N$ ($1 \\leq e_i \\leq N$), where $e_i$ is the inexperience of the $i$-th explorer.\n\nIt's guaranteed that sum of all $N$ doesn't exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $T$ numbers, each number on a separate line.\n\nIn $i$-th line print the maximum number of groups Russell can form in $i$-th test case.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n3\n1 1 1\n5\n2 3 1 2 2\n\nOutput\n3\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example we can organize three groups. There will be only one explorer in each group. It's correct because inexperience of each explorer equals to $1$, so it's not less than the size of his group.\n\nIn the second example we can organize two groups. Explorers with inexperience $1$, $2$ and $3$ will form the first group, and the other two explorers with inexperience equal to $2$ will form the second group.\n\nThis solution is not unique. For example, we can form the first group using the three explorers with inexperience equal to $2$, and the second group using only one explorer with inexperience equal to $1$. In this case the young explorer with inexperience equal to $3$ will not be included in any group. \n\n### Response:\n",

Also he likes to do programming. No wonder that he decided to attend chess classes and programming classes.\n\nAnton has n variants when he will attend chess classes, i-th variant is given by a period of time (l_{1, }i, r_{1, }i). Also he has m variants when he will attend programming classes, i-th variant is given by a period of time (l_{2, }i, r_{2, }i).\n\nAnton needs to choose exactly one of n possible periods of time when he will attend chess classes and exactly one of m possible periods of time when he will attend programming classes. He wants to have a rest between classes, so from all the possible pairs of the periods he wants to choose the one where the distance between the periods is maximal.\n\nThe distance between periods (l_1, r_1) and (l_2, r_2) is the minimal possible distance between a point in the first period and a point in the second period, that is the minimal possible |i - j|, where l_1 \u2264 i \u2264 r_1 and l_2 \u2264 j \u2264 r_2. In particular, when the periods intersect, the distance between them is 0.\n\nAnton wants to know how much time his rest between the classes will last in the best case. Help Anton and find this number!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of time periods when Anton can attend chess classes.\n\nEach of the following n lines of the input contains two integers l_{1, }i and r_{1, }i (1 \u2264 l_{1, }i \u2264 r_{1, }i \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the i-th variant of a period of time when Anton can attend chess classes.\n\nThe following line of the input contains a single integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of time periods when Anton can attend programming classes.\n\nEach of the following m lines of the input contains two integers l_{2, }i and r_{2, }i (1 \u2264 l_{2, }i \u2264 r_{2, }i \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the i-th variant of a period of time when Anton can attend programming classes.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximal possible distance between time periods.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 5\n2 6\n2 3\n2\n2 4\n6 8\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n3\n1 5\n2 6\n3 7\n2\n2 4\n1 4\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample Anton can attend chess classes in the period (2, 3) and attend programming classes in the period (6, 8). It's not hard to see that in this case the distance between the periods will be equal to 3.\n\nIn the second sample if he chooses any pair of periods, they will intersect. So the answer is 0. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: You are given a list of $n$ integers. You can perform the following operation: you choose an element $x$ from the list, erase $x$ from the list, and subtract the value of $x$ from all the remaining elements. Thus, in one operation, the length of the list is decreased by exactly $1$.\n\nGiven an integer $k$ ($k>0$), find if there is some sequence of $n-1$ operations such that, after applying the operations, the only remaining element of the list is equal to $k$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$, $1 \\leq k \\leq 10^9$), the number of integers in the list, and the target value, respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains the $n$ integers of the list $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ ($-10^9 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases is not greater that $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print YES if you can achieve $k$ with a sequence of $n-1$ operations. Otherwise, print NO.\n\nYou may print each letter in any case (for example, \"YES\", \"Yes\", \"yes\", \"yEs\" will all be recognized as a positive answer).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n4 5\n4 2 2 7\n5 4\n1 9 1 3 4\n2 17\n17 0\n2 17\n18 18\nOutput\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example we have the list $\\{4, 2, 2, 7\\}$, and we have the target $k = 5$. One way to achieve it is the following: first we choose the third element, obtaining the list $\\{2, 0, 5\\}$. Next we choose the first element, obtaining the list $\\{-2, 3\\}$. Finally, we choose the first element, obtaining the list $\\{5\\}$. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: After a hard day Vitaly got very hungry and he wants to eat his favorite potato pie. But it's not that simple. Vitaly is in the first room of the house with n room located in a line and numbered starting from one from left to right. You can go from the first room to the second room, from the second room to the third room and so on \u2014 you can go from the (n - 1)-th room to the n-th room. Thus, you can go to room x only from room x - 1.\n\nThe potato pie is located in the n-th room and Vitaly needs to go there. \n\nEach pair of consecutive rooms has a door between them. In order to go to room x from room x - 1, you need to open the door between the rooms with the corresponding key. \n\nIn total the house has several types of doors (represented by uppercase Latin letters) and several types of keys (represented by lowercase Latin letters). The key of type t can open the door of type T if and only if t and T are the same letter, written in different cases. For example, key f can open door F.\n\nEach of the first n - 1 rooms contains exactly one key of some type that Vitaly can use to get to next rooms. Once the door is open with some key, Vitaly won't get the key from the keyhole but he will immediately run into the next room. In other words, each key can open no more than one door.\n\nVitaly realizes that he may end up in some room without the key that opens the door to the next room. Before the start his run for the potato pie Vitaly can buy any number of keys of any type that is guaranteed to get to room n.\n\nGiven the plan of the house, Vitaly wants to know what is the minimum number of keys he needs to buy to surely get to the room n, which has a delicious potato pie. Write a program that will help Vitaly find out this number.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a positive integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the number of rooms in the house.\n\nThe second line of the input contains string s of length 2\u00b7n - 2. Let's number the elements of the string from left to right, starting from one. \n\nThe odd positions in the given string s contain lowercase Latin letters\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the types of the keys that lie in the corresponding rooms. Thus, each odd position i of the given string s contains a lowercase Latin letter \u2014 the type of the key that lies in room number (i + 1) / 2.\n\nThe even positions in the given string contain uppercase Latin letters \u2014 the types of doors between the rooms. Thus, each even position i of the given string s contains an uppercase letter \u2014 the type of the door that leads from room i / 2 to room i / 2 + 1.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer \u2014 the minimum number of keys that Vitaly needs to buy to surely get from room one to room n.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\naAbB\n\nOutput\n0\n\nInput\n4\naBaCaB\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n5\nxYyXzZaZ\n\nOutput\n2 \n\n### Response:\n",

One day, he was playing with them. During the play, he arranged the balls into two rows both consisting of N number of balls. These two rows of balls are given to you in the form of strings X, Y. Both these string consist of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white colored ball and 'B' a black colored.\n\nOther than these two rows of balls, Akhil has an infinite supply of extra balls of each color. he wants to create another row of N balls, Z in such a way that the sum of hamming distance between X and Z, and hamming distance between Y and Z is maximized.\n\nHamming Distance between two strings X and Y is defined as the number of positions where the color of balls in row X differs from the row Y ball at that position. e.g. hamming distance between \"WBB\", \"BWB\" is 2, as at position 1 and 2, corresponding colors in the two strings differ..\n\nAs there can be multiple such arrangements of row Z, Akhil wants you to find the lexicographically smallest arrangement which will maximize the above value. \n\n------ Input ------ \n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

Their language consists of n words numbered from 1 to n. Some words have the same meaning so there are k groups of words such that all the words in some group have the same meaning.\n\nMahmoud knows that the i-th word can be sent with cost a_{i}. For each word in his message, Mahmoud can either replace it with another word of the same meaning or leave it as it is. Can you help Mahmoud determine the minimum cost of sending the message?\n\nThe cost of sending the message is the sum of the costs of sending every word in it.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains integers n, k and m (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 1 \u2264 m \u2264 10^5)\u00a0\u2014 the number of words in their language, the number of groups of words, and the number of words in Mahmoud's message respectively.\n\nThe second line contains n strings consisting of lowercase English letters of length not exceeding 20 which represent the words. It's guaranteed that the words are distinct.\n\nThe third line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^9) where a_{i} is the cost of sending the i-th word.\n\nThe next k lines describe the groups of words of same meaning. The next k lines each start with an integer x (1 \u2264 x \u2264 n) which means that there are x words in this group, followed by x integers which represent the indices of words in this group. It's guaranteed that each word appears in exactly one group.\n\nThe next line contains m space-separated words which represent Mahmoud's message. Each of these words appears in the list of language's words.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe only line should contain the minimum cost to send the message after replacing some words (maybe none) with some words of the same meaning.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 4 4\ni loser am the second\n100 1 1 5 10\n1 1\n1 3\n2 2 5\n1 4\ni am the second\n\nOutput\n107\nInput\n5 4 4\ni loser am the second\n100 20 1 5 10\n1 1\n1 3\n2 2 5\n1 4\ni am the second\n\nOutput\n116\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Mahmoud should replace the word \"second\" with the word \"loser\" because it has less cost so the cost will be 100+1+5+1=107.\n\nIn the second sample, Mahmoud shouldn't do any replacement so the cost will be 100+1+5+10=116. \n\n### Response:\n",

Formally, in one operation you can reconfigure the thermostat from temperature $a$ to temperature $b$ if $|a - b| \\ge x$ and $l \\le b \\le r$.\n\nYou are given $l$, $r$, $x$, $a$ and $b$. Find the minimum number of operations required to get temperature $b$ from temperature $a$, or say that it is impossible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input data contains the single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\n\nThe descriptions of the test cases follow.\n\nThe first line of each case contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $x$ ($-10^9 \\le l \\le r \\le 10^9$, $1 \\le x \\le 10^9$) \u2014 range of temperature and minimum temperature change.\n\nThe second line of each case contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($l \\le a, b \\le r$) \u2014 the initial and final temperatures.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput $t$ numbers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. If it is impossible to achieve the temperature $b$, output -1, otherwise output the minimum number of operations.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n10\n3 5 6\n3 3\n0 15 5\n4 5\n0 10 5\n3 7\n3 5 6\n3 4\n-10 10 11\n-5 6\n-3 3 4\n1 0\n-5 10 8\n9 2\n1 5 1\n2 5\n-1 4 3\n0 2\n-6 3 6\n-1 -4\nOutput\n0\n2\n3\n-1\n1\n-1\n3\n1\n3\n-1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, the thermostat is already set up correctly.\n\nIn the second example, you can achieve the desired temperature as follows: $4 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 5$.\n\nIn the third example, you can achieve the desired temperature as follows: $3 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 7$.\n\nIn the fourth test, it is impossible to make any operation. \n\n### Response:\n",
