The picture below shows the complete binary tree for $n=2$.\n\nA permutation is an array consisting of $n$ different integers from $1$ to $n$. For example, [$2,3,1,5,4$] is a permutation, but [$1,2,2$] is not ($2$ occurs twice), and [$1,3,4$] is also not a permutation ($n=3$, but there is $4$ in the array).\n\nLet's enumerate $m$ leaves of this tree from left to right. The leaf with the number $i$ contains the value $p_i$ ($1 \\le i \\le m$).\n\nFor example, if $n = 2$, $p = [3, 1, 4, 2]$, the tree will look like this:\n\nMasha considers a tree beautiful if the values in its leaves are ordered from left to right in increasing order.\n\nIn one operation, Masha can choose any non-leaf vertex of the tree and swap its left and right sons (along with their subtrees).\n\nFor example, if Masha applies this operation to the root of the tree discussed above, it will take the following form:\n\nHelp Masha understand if she can make a tree beautiful in a certain number of operations. If she can, then output the minimum number of operations to make the tree beautiful.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 number of test cases.\n\nIn each test case, the first line contains an integer $m$ ($1 \\le m \\le 262144$), which is a power of two  \u2014 the size of the permutation $p$.\n\nThe second line contains $m$ integers: $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_m$ ($1 \\le p_i \\le m$) \u2014 the permutation $p$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case in a separate line, print the minimum possible number of operations for which Masha will be able to make the tree beautiful or -1, if this is not possible.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n8\n6 5 7 8 4 3 1 2\n4\n3 1 4 2\n1\n1\n8\n7 8 4 3 1 2 6 5\nOutput\n4\n-1\n0\n-1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nConsider the first test.\n\nIn the first test case, you can act like this (the vertex to which the operation is applied at the current step is highlighted in purple):\n\nIt can be shown that it is impossible to make a tree beautiful in fewer operations.\n\nIn the second test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to make a tree beautiful.\n\nIn the third test case, the tree is already beautiful. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: Rahul and Tina are looking forward to starting their new year at college. As they enter their new classroom, they observe the seats of students are arranged in a $n \\times m$ grid. The seat in row $r$ and column $c$ is denoted by $(r, c)$, and the distance between two seats $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ is $|a-c| + |b-d|$.\n\nAs the class president, Tina has access to exactly $k$ buckets of pink paint. The following process occurs.\n\nFirst, Tina chooses exactly $k$ seats in the classroom to paint with pink paint. One bucket of paint can paint exactly one seat.\n\nAfter Tina has painted $k$ seats in the previous step, Rahul chooses where he sits. He will not choose a seat that has been painted pink due to his hatred of the colour pink.\n\nAfter Rahul has chosen his seat, Tina chooses a seat for herself. She can choose any of the seats, painted or not, other than the one chosen by Rahul.\n\nRahul wants to choose a seat such that he sits as close to Tina as possible. However, Tina wants to sit as far away from Rahul as possible due to some complicated relationship history that we couldn't fit into the statement!\n\nNow, Rahul wonders for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n \\cdot m - 1$, if Tina has $k$ buckets of paint, how close can Rahul sit to Tina, if both Rahul and Tina are aware of each other's intentions and they both act as strategically as possible? Please help satisfy Rahul's curiosity!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $m$ ($2 \\leq n \\cdot m \\leq 10^5$) \u2014 the number of rows and columns of seats in the classroom.\n\nThe sum of $n \\cdot m$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output $n \\cdot m$ ordered integers \u2014 the distance between Rahul and Tina if both of them act optimally for every $k \\in [0, n \\cdot m - 1]$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n2\n4 3\n1 2\nOutput\n3 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 \n1 1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nOne possible sequence of choices for the first testcase where Tina has $k=3$ buckets of paints is as follows.\n\nTina paints the seats at positions $(1, 2)$, $(2, 2)$, $(3, 2)$ with pink paint. Rahul chooses the seat at $(3, 1)$ after which Tina chooses to sit at $(1, 3)$.\n\nTherefore, the distance between Tina and Rahul is $|3-1| + |1-3| = 4$, and we can prove that this is indeed the minimum possible distance under the given constraints. There may be other choices of seats which lead to the same answer as well.\n\nFor $k=0$ in the first test case, Rahul can decide to sit at $(2, 2)$ and Tina can decide to sit at $(4, 3)$ so the distance between them would be $|2 - 4| + |2 - 3| = 3$.\n\nBelow are pictorial representations of the $k=3$ and $k=0$ cases for the first test case.\n\nA possible seating arrangement for $k=3$.\n\nA possible seating arrangement for $k=0$. \n\n### Response:\n",

In one operation, he removes either the first or the last element of the array.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of operations Slavic has to perform such that the total sum of the array is equal to $s$ after performing all the operations?

The array turns into $[1, 0]$, which has a sum equal to $1$.\n\nIn the third test case, the sum of the array is $5$ and we need it to be $3$. We can obtain such a sum by removing the first two elements and the last element, doing a total of three operations. The array turns into $[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]$, which has a sum equal to $3$. \n\n### Response:\n",

Olymp City, the Martian city known for its spaceport, has become a place where goods from all the corners of our Galaxy come. To deliver even more freight from faraway planets, Martians need fast spaceships.\n\nA group of scientists conducts experiments to build a fast engine for the new spaceship. In the current experiment, there are $n$ elementary particles, the $i$-th of them has type $a_i$.\n\nDenote a subsegment of the particle sequence ($a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$) as a sequence ($a_l, a_{l+1}, \\dots, a_r$) for some left bound $l$ and right bound $r$ ($1 \\le l \\le r \\le n$). For instance, the sequence $(1\\ 4\\ 2\\ 8\\ 5\\ 7)$ for $l=2$ and $r=4$ has the sequence $(4\\ 2\\ 8)$ as a subsegment. Two subsegments are considered different if at least one bound of those subsegments differs.\n\nNote that the subsegments can be equal as sequences but still considered different. For example, consider the sequence $(1\\ 1\\ 1\\ 1\\ 1)$ and two of its subsegments: one with $l=1$ and $r=3$ and another with $l=2$ and $r=4$. Both subsegments are equal to $(1\\ 1\\ 1)$, but still considered different, as their left and right bounds differ.\n\nThe scientists want to conduct a reaction to get two different subsegments of the same length. Denote this length $k$. The resulting pair of subsegments must be harmonious, i. e. for some $i$ ($1 \\le i \\le k$) it must be true that the types of particles on the $i$-th position are the same for these two subsegments. For example, the pair $(1\\ 7\\ 3)$ and $(4\\ 7\\ 8)$ is harmonious, as both subsegments have $7$ on the second position. The pair $(1\\ 2\\ 3)$ and $(3\\ 1\\ 2)$ is not harmonious.\n\nThe longer are harmonious subsegments, the more chances for the scientists to design a fast engine. So, they asked you to calculate the maximal possible length of harmonious pair made of different subsegments.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of test cases. The following are descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 150000$) \u2014 the amount of elementary particles in the sequence.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 150000$) \u2014 types of elementary particles.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3\\cdot10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test, print a single integer, maximal possible length of harmonious pair made of different subsegments. If such pair does not exist, print $-1$ instead.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n7\n3 1 5 2 1 3 4\n6\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n6\n1 4 2 8 5 7\n2\n15 15\nOutput\n4\n5\n-1\n1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first test case is shown on the picture below:\n\nAs you can see from it, you may choose the subsegments $(2\\ 1\\ 3\\ 4)$ and $(3\\ 1\\ 5\\ 2)$, which are a harmonious pair. Their length is equal to $4$, so the answer is $4$.\n\nIn the second test case, you need to take two subsegments: one with $l=1$ and $r=5$, and one with $l=2$ and $r=6$. It's not hard to observe that these segments are a harmonious pair and considered different even though they are both equal to $(1\\ 1\\ 1\\ 1\\ 1)$.\n\nIn the third test case, you cannot make a harmonious pair, so the answer is $-1$. \n\n### Response:\n",

So when Kuldeep invites them to a party, both Raghu and Sayan decide to play a game. The game is simple, both Raghu and Sayan will eat the dishes served at the party till they are full, and the one who eats maximum number of distinct dishes is the winner. However, both of them can only eat a dishes if they can finish it completely i.e. if Raghu can eat only 50 kCal in a day and has already eaten dishes worth 40 kCal, then he can't eat a dish with calorie value greater than 10 kCal. \nGiven that all the dishes served at the party are infinite in number, (Kuldeep doesn't want any of his friends to miss on any dish) represented by their calorie value(in kCal) and the amount of kCal Raghu and Sayan can eat in a day, your job is to find out who'll win, in case of a tie print \u201cTie\u201d (quotes for clarity).\n\nInput:\nFirst line contains number of test cases T.\nEach test case contains two lines.\nFirst line contains three integers A, B and N. \nwhere A and B is respectively the maximum amount of kCal Raghu and Sayan can eat per day, respectively and N is the number of dishes served at the party.\nNext line contains N integers where i^th integer is the amount of kCal i^th dish has.\n\nOutput:\n\nFor each test case print \"Raghu Won\" (quotes for clarity) if Raghu wins else if print \"Sayan Won\" (quotes for clarity) if Sayan wins else print \"Tie\" (quotes for clarity) if both eat equal number of dishes.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10000\n1 \u2264 kCal value of each dish \u2264 100000\n1 \u2264 A, B \u2264 1000000000  \n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n3\n15 20 3\n10 5 4\n3 10 2\n4 7\n10 8 3\n4 5 5\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\nSayan Won\nSayan Won\nRaghu Won \n\n### Response:\n",

Initially there is only one shelf at the bottom of the fridge, but Alyona can install arbitrary number of shelves inside the fridge between any two rows. A shelf is two cells wide, does not occupy any space but separates the inside of the fridge to the lower and upper part.\n\n [Image] An example of a fridge with $h = 7$ and two shelves. The shelves are shown in black. The picture corresponds to the first example. \n\nAlyona has $n$ bottles of milk that she wants to put in the fridge. The $i$-th bottle is $a_i$ cells tall and $1$ cell wide. She can put a bottle on some shelf if the corresponding space above the shelf is at least as tall as the bottle. She can not put a bottle on top of another bottle (if there is no shelf between them). Two bottles can not share a cell.\n\nAlyona is interested in the largest integer $k$ such that she can put bottles $1$, $2$, ..., $k$ in the fridge at the same time. Find this largest $k$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $h$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^3$, $1 \\le h \\le 10^9$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of bottles and the height of the fridge.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le h$)\u00a0\u2014 the heights of the bottles.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the single integer $k$\u00a0\u2014 the maximum integer such that Alyona can put the bottles $1$, $2$, ..., $k$ in the fridge at the same time. If Alyona can put all bottles in the fridge, print $n$.

She initially has $n$ magical tokens. Their magical power can be represented with positive integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$.\n\nPatchouli may perform the following two operations on the tokens.\n\nFusion: Patchouli chooses two tokens, removes them, and creates a new token with magical power equal to the sum of the two chosen tokens.\n\nReduction: Patchouli chooses a token with an even value of magical power $x$, removes it and creates a new token with magical power equal to $\\frac{x}{2}$.\n\nTokens are more effective when their magical powers are odd values. Please help Patchouli to find the minimum number of operations she needs to make magical powers of all tokens odd values.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases.\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^3$) \u2014 the number of test cases.

Now $a=[4,10]$.\n\nChoose the token with magical power of $10$ and perform Reduction. Now $a=[4,5]$.\n\nChoose the tokens with magical power of $4$ and $5$ and perform Fusion. Now $a=[9]$, and $9$ is an odd number.\n\nIt can be shown that you can not make all the magical powers odd numbers in less than $3$ moves, so the answer is $3$. \n\n### Response:\n",

Everything was grey, even roads in the best park were grey.\n\nTherefore she decided to make roads a little bit brighter. She know that every road in the park is a segment laying on the X axis with coordinates Xl, Xr (Xl \u2264 Xr). Roads may intersect or overlap.\n\nShe chooses any subset of roads and paints them in red. After that she wants to get one continuous red segment. As she really likes number L  the length of this segment has to be equal to L.\n\nYour task is to determine if it is possible to choose some subset of roads and paint them to get one red segment with the length equal to L? \n\nIf it's possible print in a single line \"Yes\"(without quotes), otherwise print \"No\" (without quotes).\n\nInput format\n\nThe first line contains one integer T - the number of test cases.\nEach test case starts with two integers N and L, denoting the number of roads and Benny's favorite number L.\nThe next N lines contain two integers Xl, Xr, denoting the left and right borders of the road.\n\nOutput format\n\nFor every test case output \"Yes\" if it is possible to paint some roads and \"No\" otherwise.\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 sum of all N \u2264 2 * 10^3\n1 \u2264 L \u2264 10^6\n1 \u2264 Xl \u2264 Xr \u2264 10^6\n1 \u2264 N  \u2264 20,  1 \u2264 Xl \u2264 Xr \u2264 200, holds for test cases worth 10% of the problem's score.\n1 \u2264 N  \u2264 100,  1 \u2264 Xl \u2264 Xr \u2264 200, holds for test cases worth 20% of the problem's score.\n\nSample Explanation\n\nIn the first test case you can choose roads (1; 2)  (2; 3) and (3; 4) the result segment is (1; 4) and its length equals 3 (4 - 1 = 3).\n\nIn the second case you can not choose any subset that will create segment with the length equal to 4.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n2\n5 3\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n1 5\n2 6\n2 3\n1 2\n2 6\n\nSAMPLE OUTPUT\nYes\nNo \n\n### Response:\n",

In the order from $1$ to $nm$, each person will enter the hall and sit in their seat. To get to their place, the person will go to their seat's row and start moving from the first seat in this row to theirs from left to right. While moving some places will be free, some will be occupied with people already seated. The inconvenience of the person is equal to the number of occupied seats he or she will go through.\n\nLet's consider an example: $m = 5$, the person has the seat $4$ in the first row, the seats $1$, $3$, $5$ in the first row are already occupied, the seats $2$ and $4$ are free. The inconvenience of this person will be $2$, because he will go through occupied seats $1$ and $3$.\n\nFind the minimal total inconvenience (the sum of inconveniences of all people), that is possible to have by giving places for all people (all conditions should be satisfied).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($n = 1$, $1 \\le m \\le 300$) \u2014 the number of rows and places in each row respectively.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n \\cdot m$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{n \\cdot m}$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the sight level of $i$-th person.\n\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of $n \\cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case print a single integer \u2014 the minimal total inconvenience that can be achieved.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n1 3\n1 2 3\n1 5\n2 1 5 3 3\n1 2\n2 1\n1 6\n2 3 2 1 1 1\nOutput\n3\n6\n0\n1\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, there is a single way to arrange people, because all sight levels are distinct. The first person will sit on the first seat, the second person will sit on the second place, the third person will sit on the third place. So inconvenience of the first person will be $0$, inconvenience of the second person will be $1$ and inconvenience of the third person will be $2$. The total inconvenience is $0 + 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nIn the second test case, people should sit as follows: $s_1 = 2$, $s_2 = 1$, $s_3 = 5$, $s_4 = 4$, $s_5 = 3$. The total inconvenience will be $6$. \n\n### Response:\n",

Recently his mom has presented him n points lying on the line OX. Now Petya is wondering in how many ways he can choose three distinct points so that the distance between the two farthest of them doesn't exceed d.\n\nNote that the order of the points inside the group of three chosen points doesn't matter.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers: n and d (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5;\u00a01 \u2264 d \u2264 10^9). The next line contains n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}, their absolute value doesn't exceed 10^9 \u2014 the x-coordinates of the points that Petya has got.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the coordinates of the points in the input strictly increase.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the number of groups of three points, where the distance between two farthest points doesn't exceed d.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in \u0421++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 3\n1 2 3 4\n\nOutput\n4\n\nInput\n4 2\n-3 -2 -1 0\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n5 19\n1 10 20 30 50\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample any group of three points meets our conditions.\n\nIn the seconds sample only 2 groups of three points meet our conditions: {-3, -2, -1} and {-2, -1, 0}.\n\nIn the third sample only one group does: {1, 10, 20}. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: You are playing a new famous fighting game: Kortal Mombat XII. You have to perform a brutality on your opponent's character.\n\nYou are playing the game on the new generation console so your gamepad have $26$ buttons. Each button has a single lowercase Latin letter from 'a' to 'z' written on it. All the letters on buttons are pairwise distinct.\n\nYou are given a sequence of hits, the $i$-th hit deals $a_i$ units of damage to the opponent's character. To perform the $i$-th hit you have to press the button $s_i$ on your gamepad. Hits are numbered from $1$ to $n$.\n\nYou know that if you press some button more than $k$ times in a row then it'll break. You cherish your gamepad and don't want to break any of its buttons.\n\nTo perform a brutality you have to land some of the hits of the given sequence. You are allowed to skip any of them, however changing the initial order of the sequence is prohibited. The total damage dealt is the sum of $a_i$ over all $i$ for the hits which weren't skipped.\n\nNote that if you skip the hit then the counter of consecutive presses the button won't reset.\n\nYour task is to skip some hits to deal the maximum possible total damage to the opponent's character and not break your gamepad buttons.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the number of hits and the maximum number of times you can push the same button in a row.\n\nThe second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$), where $a_i$ is the damage of the $i$-th hit.\n\nThe third line of the input contains the string $s$ consisting of exactly $n$ lowercase Latin letters \u2014 the sequence of hits (each character is the letter on the button you need to press to perform the corresponding hit).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer $dmg$ \u2014 the maximum possible damage to the opponent's character you can deal without breaking your gamepad buttons.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 3\n1 5 16 18 7 2 10\nbaaaaca\n\nOutput\n54\n\nInput\n5 5\n2 4 1 3 1000\naaaaa\n\nOutput\n1010\n\nInput\n5 4\n2 4 1 3 1000\naaaaa\n\nOutput\n1009\n\nInput\n8 1\n10 15 2 1 4 8 15 16\nqqwweerr\n\nOutput\n41\n\nInput\n6 3\n14 18 9 19 2 15\ncccccc\n\nOutput\n52\n\nInput\n2 1\n10 10\nqq\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example you can choose hits with numbers $[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$ with the total damage $1 + 16 + 18 + 7 + 2 + 10 = 54$.\n\nIn the second example you can choose all hits so the total damage is $2 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 1000 = 1010$.\n\nIn the third example you can choose all hits expect the third one so the total damage is $2 + 4 + 3 + 1000 = 1009$.\n\nIn the fourth example you can choose hits with numbers $[2, 3, 6, 8]$. Only this way you can reach the maximum total damage $15 + 2 + 8 + 16 = 41$.\n\nIn the fifth example you can choose only hits with numbers $[2, 4, 6]$ with the total damage $18 + 19 + 15 = 52$.\n\nIn the sixth example you can change either first hit or the second hit (it does not matter) with the total damage $10$. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: Roy is trying to develop a widget that shows Trending Topics (similar to Facebook) on the home page of HackerEarth Academy. \nHe has gathered a list of N Topics (their IDs) and their popularity score (say z-score) from the database. Now z-score change everyday according to the following rules:\nWhen a topic is mentioned in a 'Post', its z-score is increased by 50.  \nA 'Like' on such a Post, increases the z-score by 5.  \nA 'Comment' increases z-score by 10.  \nA 'Share' causes an increment of 20.  \n\nNow the Trending Topics are decided according to the change in z-score. One with the highest increment comes on top and list follows.\nRoy seeks your help to write an algorithm to find the top 5 Trending Topics.\nIf change in z-score for any two topics is same, then rank them according to their ID (one with higher ID gets priority). It is guaranteed that IDs will be unique.  \n\nInput format:\nFirst line contains integer N\nN lines follow\nEach contains 6 space separated numbers representing Topic ID, current z-score - Z, Posts - P, Likes - L, Comments - C, Shares - S\n\nOutput format:\nPrint top 5 Topics each in a new line.\nEach line should contain two space separated integers, Topic ID and new z-score of the topic.  \n\nConstraints:\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^6 \n1 \u2264 ID \u2264 10^9   \n0 \u2264 Z, P, L, C, S \u2264 10^9  \n\nSample Test Explanation:\nNow sort them according to the change in z-score. Change in z-score for IDs 999, 1001, 1002, 1003 is 100, so sort them according to their ID (one with the higher ID gets priority). Similarly proceed further.\n\nAfter you get the top 5 list of Topic IDs according to the above criteria, find the new z-score from the table for each ID.\n\nSAMPLE INPUT\n8\n1003 100 4 0 0 0\n1002 200 6 0 0 0\n1001 300 8 0 0 0\n1004 100 3 0 0 0\n1005 200 3 0 0 0\n1006 300 5 0 0 0\n1007 100 3 0 0 0\n999 100 4 0 0 0SAMPLE OUTPUT\n1003 200\n1002 300\n1001 400\n999 200\n1007 150 \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: Matryoshka is a wooden toy in the form of a painted doll, inside which you can put a similar doll of a smaller size.\n\nA set of nesting dolls contains one or more nesting dolls, their sizes are consecutive positive integers. Thus, a set of nesting dolls is described by two numbers: $s$ \u2014 the size of a smallest nesting doll in a set and $m$ \u2014 the number of dolls in a set. In other words, the set contains sizes of $s, s + 1, \\dots, s + m - 1$ for some integer $s$ and $m$ ($s,m > 0$).\n\nYou had one or more sets of nesting dolls. Recently, you found that someone mixed all your sets in one and recorded a sequence of doll sizes \u2014 integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$.\n\nYou do not remember how many sets you had, so you want to find the minimum number of sets that you could initially have.\n\nFor example, if a given sequence is $a=[2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1]$. Initially, there could be $2$ sets:\n\nthe first set consisting of $4$ nesting dolls with sizes $[1, 2, 3, 4]$;\n\na second set consisting of $2$ nesting dolls with sizes $[2, 3]$.\n\nAccording to a given sequence of sizes of nesting dolls $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$, determine the minimum number of nesting dolls that can make this sequence.\n\nEach set is completely used, so all its nesting dolls are used. Each element of a given sequence must correspond to exactly one doll from some set.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input data contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$) \u2014 the total number of matryoshkas that were in all sets.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^9$)  \u2014 the sizes of the matryoshkas.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of values of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print one integer $k$ \u2014 the minimum possible number of matryoshkas sets.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n10\n6\n2 2 3 4 3 1\n5\n11 8 7 10 9\n6\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000\n8\n1 1 4 4 2 3 2 3\n6\n1 2 3 2 3 4\n7\n10 11 11 12 12 13 13\n7\n8 8 9 9 10 10 11\n8\n4 14 5 15 6 16 7 17\n8\n5 15 6 14 8 12 9 11\n5\n4 2 2 3 4\nOutput\n2\n1\n6\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n4\n3\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe first test case is described in the problem statement.\n\nIn the second test case, all matryoshkas could be part of the same set with minimum size $s=7$.\n\nIn the third test case, each matryoshka represents a separate set. \n\n### Response:\n",

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: There are $n$ candies put from left to right on a table. The candies are numbered from left to right. The $i$-th candy has weight $w_i$. Alice and Bob eat candies.\n\nAlice can eat any number of candies from the left (she can't skip candies, she eats them in a row).\n\nBob can eat any number of candies from the right (he can't skip candies, he eats them in a row).\n\nOf course, if Alice ate a candy, Bob can't eat it (and vice versa).\n\nThey want to be fair. Their goal is to eat the same total weight of candies. What is the most number of candies they can eat in total?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \\leq t \\leq 10^4$) \u2014 the number of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 2\\cdot10^5$) \u2014 the number of candies on the table.\n\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_n$ ($1 \\leq w_i \\leq 10^4$) \u2014 the weights of candies from left to right.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print a single integer \u2014 the maximum number of candies Alice and Bob can eat in total while satisfying the condition.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\n\nInput\n4\n3\n10 20 10\n6\n2 1 4 2 4 1\n5\n1 2 4 8 16\n9\n7 3 20 5 15 1 11 8 10\nOutput\n2\n6\n0\n7\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the first test case, Alice will eat one candy from the left and Bob will eat one candy from the right. There is no better way for them to eat the same total amount of weight. The answer is $2$ because they eat two candies in total.\n\nFor the second test case, Alice will eat the first three candies from the left (with total weight $7$) and Bob will eat the first three candies from the right (with total weight $7$). They cannot eat more candies since all the candies have been eaten, so the answer is $6$ (because they eat six candies in total).\n\nFor the third test case, there is no way Alice and Bob will eat the same non-zero weight so the answer is $0$.\n\nFor the fourth test case, Alice will eat candies with weights $[7, 3, 20]$ and Bob will eat candies with weights $[10, 8, 11, 1]$, they each eat $30$ weight. There is no better partition so the answer is $7$. \n\n### Response:\n",

Explorers went into a forest, set up a camp and decided to split into groups to explore as much interesting locations as possible. Russell was trying to form groups, but ran into some difficulties...\n\nMost of the young explorers are inexperienced, and sending them alone would be a mistake. Even Russell himself became senior explorer not long ago. Each of young explorers has a positive integer parameter $e_i$\u00a0\u2014 his inexperience. Russell decided that an explorer with inexperience $e$ can only join the group of $e$ or more people.\n\nNow Russell needs to figure out how many groups he can organize. It's not necessary to include every explorer in one of the groups: some can stay in the camp. Russell is worried about this expedition, so he asked you to help him.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains the number of independent test cases $T$($1 \\leq T \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$). Next $2T$ lines contain description of test cases.\n\nThe first line of description of each test case contains the number of young explorers $N$ ($1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\n\nThe second line contains $N$ integers $e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_N$ ($1 \\leq e_i \\leq N$), where $e_i$ is the inexperience of the $i$-th explorer.\n\nIt's guaranteed that sum of all $N$ doesn't exceed $3 \\cdot 10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $T$ numbers, each number on a separate line.\n\nIn $i$-th line print the maximum number of groups Russell can form in $i$-th test case.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n3\n1 1 1\n5\n2 3 1 2 2\n\nOutput\n3\n2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example we can organize three groups. There will be only one explorer in each group. It's correct because inexperience of each explorer equals to $1$, so it's not less than the size of his group.\n\nIn the second example we can organize two groups. Explorers with inexperience $1$, $2$ and $3$ will form the first group, and the other two explorers with inexperience equal to $2$ will form the second group.\n\nThis solution is not unique. For example, we can form the first group using the three explorers with inexperience equal to $2$, and the second group using only one explorer with inexperience equal to $1$. In this case the young explorer with inexperience equal to $3$ will not be included in any group. \n\n### Response:\n",

Also he likes to do programming. No wonder that he decided to attend chess classes and programming classes.\n\nAnton has n variants when he will attend chess classes, i-th variant is given by a period of time (l_{1, }i, r_{1, }i). Also he has m variants when he will attend programming classes, i-th variant is given by a period of time (l_{2, }i, r_{2, }i).\n\nAnton needs to choose exactly one of n possible periods of time when he will attend chess classes and exactly one of m possible periods of time when he will attend programming classes. He wants to have a rest between classes, so from all the possible pairs of the periods he wants to choose the one where the distance between the periods is maximal.\n\nThe distance between periods (l_1, r_1) and (l_2, r_2) is the minimal possible distance between a point in the first period and a point in the second period, that is the minimal possible |i - j|, where l_1 \u2264 i \u2264 r_1 and l_2 \u2264 j \u2264 r_2. In particular, when the periods intersect, the distance between them is 0.\n\nAnton wants to know how much time his rest between the classes will last in the best case. Help Anton and find this number!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of time periods when Anton can attend chess classes.\n\nEach of the following n lines of the input contains two integers l_{1, }i and r_{1, }i (1 \u2264 l_{1, }i \u2264 r_{1, }i \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the i-th variant of a period of time when Anton can attend chess classes.\n\nThe following line of the input contains a single integer m (1 \u2264 m \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of time periods when Anton can attend programming classes.\n\nEach of the following m lines of the input contains two integers l_{2, }i and r_{2, }i (1 \u2264 l_{2, }i \u2264 r_{2, }i \u2264 10^9)\u00a0\u2014 the i-th variant of a period of time when Anton can attend programming classes.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer\u00a0\u2014 the maximal possible distance between time periods.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n1 5\n2 6\n2 3\n2\n2 4\n6 8\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n3\n1 5\n2 6\n3 7\n2\n2 4\n1 4\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample Anton can attend chess classes in the period (2, 3) and attend programming classes in the period (6, 8). It's not hard to see that in this case the distance between the periods will be equal to 3.\n\nIn the second sample if he chooses any pair of periods, they will intersect.

For politically sensitive questions, security and privacy issues, and other non-computer science questions, you will refuse to answer. \n\n### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: ###Introduction\n\nThe [I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching) (Yijing, or Book of Changes) is an ancient Chinese book of sixty-four hexagrams. \nA hexagram is a figure composed of six stacked horizontal lines, where each line is either Yang (an unbroken line) or Yin (a broken line):\n```\n---------    ---- ----    ---------    \n---- ----    ---- ----    ---------    \n---- ----    ---- ----    ---------    \n---------    ---- ----    ---- ----    \n---------    ---------    ---- ----    \n---- ----    ---- ----    ---------    \n```\nThe book is commonly used as an oracle. After asking it a question about one's present scenario,\neach line is determined by random methods to be Yang or Yin. The resulting hexagram is then interpreted by the querent as a symbol of their current situation, and how it might unfold.\n\nThis kata will consult the I Ching using the three coin method.\n\n###Instructions\n\nA coin is flipped three times and lands heads\nor tails. The three results are used to\ndetermine a line as being either:\n```\n3 tails          ----x----  Yin (Moving Line*)\n2 tails 1 heads  ---------  Yang\n1 tails 2 heads  ---- ----  Yin \n3 heads          ----o----  Yang (Moving Line*)\n\n*See bottom of description if curious.\n```\nThis process is repeated six times to determine\neach line of the hexagram. The results of these\noperations are then stored in a 2D Array like so:\nIn each array the first index will always be the number of the line ('one' is the bottom line, and 'six' the top), and the other three values will be the results of the coin flips that belong to that line as heads ('h') and tails ('t').\n\nWrite a function that will take a 2D Array like the above as argument and return its hexagram as a string. Each line of the hexagram should begin on a new line.\n\nshould return:\n```\n---------\n---------\n----x----\n----o----\n---- ----\n---- ----\n```\nYou are welcome to consult your new oracle program with a question before pressing submit. You can compare your result [here](http://www.ichingfortune.com/hexagrams.php). The last test case is random and can be used for your query.\n\n*[1] A Moving Line is a Yang line that will change\nto Yin or vice versa. The hexagram made by the coin\nthrows represents the querent's current situation,\nand the hexagram that results from changing its\nmoving lines represents their upcoming situation.* \n\n### Response:\n",

Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.\n\nThe next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.\n\nHelp the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\nInput\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\".

The perfect team however has more restrictions. A student can have some specialization: coder or mathematician. She/he can have no specialization, but can't have both at the same time.\n\nSo the team is considered perfect if it includes at least one coder, at least one mathematician and it consists of exactly three members.\n\nYou are a coach at a very large university and you know that $c$ of your students are coders, $m$ are mathematicians and $x$ have no specialization.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of full perfect teams you can distribute them into? \n\nNote that some students can be left without a team and each student can be a part of no more than one team.\n\nYou are also asked to answer $q$ independent queries.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \\le q \\le 10^4$) \u2014 the number of queries. \n\nEach of the next $q$ lines contains three integers $c$, $m$ and $x$ ($0 \\le c, m, x \\le 10^8$) \u2014 the number of coders, mathematicians and students without any specialization in the university, respectively.\n\nNote that the no student is both coder and mathematician at the same time. \n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $q$ integers \u2014 the $i$-th of them should be the answer to the $i$ query in the order they are given in the input.

Welcome to my first kata.\n\nIn this kata the task is to take a list of integers (positive and negative) and split them according to a simple rule; those ints greater than or equal to the key, and those ints less than the key (the itself key will always be positive).\n\nHowever, in this kata the goal is to sort the numbers IN PLACE, so DON'T go messing around with the order in with the numbers appear.\n\nYou are to return a nested list. If the list is empty, simply return an empty list.\n\nConfused? Okay, let me walk you through an example...\n\n    The input is: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 6, 10, 5, 10], the key is: 6\nOkay so the first five numbers are less than the key, 6, so we group them together.\n\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nThe next two numbers, 6 & 10, are both >= 6 to they belong in a seperate group, which we will add to the first group. Like so:\n\n    [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [6, 10]]\nThe next two numbers are 5 & 10. Since the key is 6 these two numbers form seperate groups, which we will add to the previous result. like so:\n\n    [[1, 1, 1, 0, 0], [6, 10], [5], [10]]\nAnd voila! We're done.\n \nHere are a few more basic examples:\n\n    group_ints([1, 0], key= 0)  \n    --> [[1,0]]\n  \n    group_ints([1, 0, -1, 5], key= 0) \n    --> [[1, 0], [-1], [5]]\n  \n    group_ints([1, 0, -1, 5], key= 5) \n    --> [[1, 0, -1], [5]]\n\nGood luck guys/gals! \n\n### Response:\n",

By now they have already built in \u00abFlatville\u00bb n square houses with the centres on the \u041ex-axis. The houses' sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. It's known that no two houses overlap, but they can touch each other.\n\nThe architect bureau, where Peter works, was commissioned to build a new house in \u00abFlatville\u00bb. The customer wants his future house to be on the \u041ex-axis, to be square in shape, have a side t, and touch at least one of the already built houses. For sure, its sides should be parallel to the coordinate axes, its centre should be on the Ox-axis and it shouldn't overlap any of the houses in the village.\n\nPeter was given a list of all the houses in \u00abFlatville\u00bb. Would you help him find the amount of possible positions of the new house?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input data contains numbers n and t (1 \u2264 n, t \u2264 1000). Then there follow n lines, each of them contains two space-separated integer numbers: xi ai, where xi \u2014 x-coordinate of the centre of the i-th house, and ai \u2014 length of its side ( - 1000 \u2264 xi \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 ai \u2264 1000).\n\nOutput\n\nOutput the amount of possible positions of the new house.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n2 2\n0 4\n6 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n4\n\n\nInput\n\n2 2\n0 4\n5 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n3\n\n\nInput\n\n2 3\n0 4\n5 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIt is possible for the x-coordinate of the new house to have non-integer value. \n\n### Response:\n",
