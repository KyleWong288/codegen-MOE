Today he has an array A of length N consisting of positive integers. Chef's little brother likes to follow his elder brother, so he thought of creating an array B of length N. The little brother is too small to think of new numbers himself, so he decided to use all the elements of array A to create the array B. In other words, array B is obtained by shuffling the elements of array A.\n\nThe little brother doesn't want Chef to know that he has copied the elements of his array A. Therefore, he wants to create the array B in such a way that the Hamming distance between the two arrays A and B is maximized. The Hamming distance between A and B is the number of indices i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 N) such that A_{i} \u2260 B_{i}.\n\nThe brother needs your help in finding any such array B. Can you please find one such array for him?\n\nNote that it's guaranteed that no element in A appears more than twice, i.e. frequency of each element is at most 2.\n\n------ Input ------ \n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.

{"text": "### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: Shichikuji is the new resident deity of the South Black Snail Temple. Her first job is as follows:\n\nThere are n new cities located in Prefecture X. Cities are numbered from 1 to n. City i is located x_i km North of the shrine and y_i km East of the shrine. It is possible that (x_i, y_i) = (x_j, y_j) even when i \\ne j.\n\nShichikuji must provide electricity to each city either by building a power station in that city, or by making a connection between that city and another one that already has electricity. So the City has electricity if it has a power station in it or it is connected to a City which has electricity by a direct connection or via a chain of connections.\n\n    Building a power station in City i will cost c_i yen;     Making a connection between City i and City j will cost k_i + k_j yen per km of wire used for the connection. However, wires can only go the cardinal directions (North, South, East, West). Wires can cross each other. Each wire must have both of its endpoints in some cities. If City i and City j are connected by a wire, the wire will go through any shortest path from City i to City j. Thus, the length of the wire if City i and City j are connected is |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j| km. \n\nShichikuji wants to do this job spending as little money as possible, since according to her, there isn't really anything else in the world other than money. However, she died when she was only in fifth grade so she is not smart enough for this. And thus, the new resident deity asks for your help.\n\nAnd so, you have to provide Shichikuji with the following information: minimum amount of yen needed to provide electricity to all cities, the cities in which power stations will be built, and the connections to be made.\n\nIf there are multiple ways to choose the cities and the connections to obtain the construction of minimum price, then print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of input contains a single integer n (1 <=q n <=q 2000) \u2014 the number of cities.\n\nThen, n lines follow. The i-th line contains two space-separated integers x_i (1 <=q x_i <=q 10^6) and y_i (1 <=q y_i <=q 10^6) \u2014 the coordinates of the i-th city.\n\nThe next line contains n space-separated integers c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n (1 <=q c_i <=q 10^9) \u2014 the cost of building a power station in the i-th city.\n\nThe last line contains n space-separated integers k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_n (1 <=q k_i <=q 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print a single integer, denoting the minimum amount of yen needed.\n\nThen, print an integer v \u2014 the number of power stations to be built.\n\nNext, print v space-separated integers, denoting the indices of cities in which a power station will be built. Each number should be from 1 to n and all numbers should be pairwise distinct. You can print the numbers in arbitrary order.\n\nAfter that, print an integer e \u2014 the number of connections to be made.\n\nFinally, print e pairs of integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= n, a \\ne b), denoting that a connection between City a and City b will be made. Each unordered pair of cities should be included at most once (for each (a, b) there should be no more (a, b) or (b, a) pairs). You can print the pairs in arbitrary order.\n\nIf there are multiple ways to choose the cities and the connections to obtain the construction of minimum price, then print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n2 3\n1 1\n3 2\n3 2 3\n3 2 3\n\nOutput\n8\n3\n1 2 3 \n0\n\nInput\n3\n2 1\n1 2\n3 3\n23 2 23\n3 2 3\n\nOutput\n27\n1\n2 \n2\n1 2\n2 3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the answers given in the samples, refer to the following diagrams (cities with power stations are colored green, other cities are colored blue, and wires are colored red):\n\n[Image]\n\nFor the first example, the cost of building power stations in all cities is 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.

Her first job is as follows:\n\nThere are n new cities located in Prefecture X. Cities are numbered from 1 to n. City i is located x_i km North of the shrine and y_i km East of the shrine. It is possible that (x_i, y_i) = (x_j, y_j) even when i \\ne j.\n\nShichikuji must provide electricity to each city either by building a power station in that city, or by making a connection between that city and another one that already has electricity. So the City has electricity if it has a power station in it or it is connected to a City which has electricity by a direct connection or via a chain of connections.\n\n    Building a power station in City i will cost c_i yen;     Making a connection between City i and City j will cost k_i + k_j yen per km of wire used for the connection. However, wires can only go the cardinal directions (North, South, East, West). Wires can cross each other. Each wire must have both of its endpoints in some cities. If City i and City j are connected by a wire, the wire will go through any shortest path from City i to City j. Thus, the length of the wire if City i and City j are connected is |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j| km. \n\nShichikuji wants to do this job spending as little money as possible, since according to her, there isn't really anything else in the world other than money. However, she died when she was only in fifth grade so she is not smart enough for this. And thus, the new resident deity asks for your help.\n\nAnd so, you have to provide Shichikuji with the following information: minimum amount of yen needed to provide electricity to all cities, the cities in which power stations will be built, and the connections to be made.\n\nIf there are multiple ways to choose the cities and the connections to obtain the construction of minimum price, then print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nFirst line of input contains a single integer n (1 <=q n <=q 2000) \u2014 the number of cities.\n\nThen, n lines follow. The i-th line contains two space-separated integers x_i (1 <=q x_i <=q 10^6) and y_i (1 <=q y_i <=q 10^6) \u2014 the coordinates of the i-th city.\n\nThe next line contains n space-separated integers c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n (1 <=q c_i <=q 10^9) \u2014 the cost of building a power station in the i-th city.\n\nThe last line contains n space-separated integers k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_n (1 <=q k_i <=q 10^9).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print a single integer, denoting the minimum amount of yen needed.\n\nThen, print an integer v \u2014 the number of power stations to be built.\n\nNext, print v space-separated integers, denoting the indices of cities in which a power station will be built. Each number should be from 1 to n and all numbers should be pairwise distinct. You can print the numbers in arbitrary order.\n\nAfter that, print an integer e \u2014 the number of connections to be made.\n\nFinally, print e pairs of integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= n, a \\ne b), denoting that a connection between City a and City b will be made. Each unordered pair of cities should be included at most once (for each (a, b) there should be no more (a, b) or (b, a) pairs). You can print the pairs in arbitrary order.\n\nIf there are multiple ways to choose the cities and the connections to obtain the construction of minimum price, then print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n2 3\n1 1\n3 2\n3 2 3\n3 2 3\n\nOutput\n8\n3\n1 2 3 \n0\n\nInput\n3\n2 1\n1 2\n3 3\n23 2 23\n3 2 3\n\nOutput\n27\n1\n2 \n2\n1 2\n2 3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nFor the answers given in the samples, refer to the following diagrams (cities with power stations are colored green, other cities are colored blue, and wires are colored red):\n\n[Image]\n\nFor the first example, the cost of building power stations in all cities is 3 + 2 + 3 = 8. It can be shown that no configuration costs less than 8 yen.\n\nFor the second example, the cost of building a power station in City 2 is 2. The cost of connecting City 1 and City 2 is 2 \\cdot (3 + 2) = 10. The cost of connecting City 2 and City 3 is 3 \\cdot (2 + 3) = 15. Thus the total cost is 2 + 10 + 15 = 27.

{"text": "### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: The country of BitLand is divided into N districts, and these districts are arranged in a circle: 1, 2, 3, ..., N, where i and i+1 are adjacent for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N-1, and also 1 and N are adjacent. It is given that N = o_{1} * o_{2}, where o_{1} and o_{2} are odd integers.\n\nThere are only 2 political parties in BitLand: the Zeros and the Ones. There was an election, in which each district chose it's representative who is either a Zero or a One. We know this data. i.e. for each of the N districts, we know whether their representative is a Zero or a One.\n\nThe N districts should be partitioned into o_{1} states, where each state consists of o_{2} consecutive districts.\n\nFor example, if o_{1} = 5 and o_{2}=3, then N=15, and {1,2,3} would be a valid state. {2,3,4}, {13,14,15}, {14,15,1}, {15,1,2} are other examples of valid states. But {3,5,6} is not a valid state, because the districts are not consecutive.\n\nA state gets a One Governor if, among all the o_{2} district representatives belonging to it, there are more One district representatives than Zero representatives. And it gets a Governor who is from the Zero party, if the majority of its district representatives are from the Zero party. And because o_{2} is odd, there will be no ties.\n\nThe President of BitLand will be a One if the majority of the o_{1} state Governors are Ones. Otherwise, the President will be from the Zero party.\n\nBut the state boundaries have not been fixed yet. Given just the district-wise data (i.e. whether each district's representative is a Zero or a One), you need to find if there is a way to partition them into states such that the President is a One.\n\n------ Input ------ \n\nThe first line contains one integer, T, which is the number of testcases.\nThe first line of each testcase contains two space separated integers, o_{1} and o_{2}, which are the number of states, and number of districts in each state, respectively.\n\nThe next line of each testcase contains N = o_{1} * o_{2} space separated integers: d_{1}, d_{2}, .., d_{N}. If d_{i} is 1, then it signifies that District i has chosen a One representative. If d_{i} is 0, then they have a Zero representative.\n\n------ Output ------ \n\nEach testcase should be in a new line, and should contain 1, if the President can be a One, and 0 otherwise.\n\n------ Constraints ------ \n\nFor all subtasks you may assume that: \n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100o_{1},o_{2} will be odd positive integers.\n\n1 \u2264 Summation of o_{1}*o_{2} over all testcases \u2264 10^{6}\n0 \u2264 d_{i} \u2264 1\n\nSubtask 1: For 10% of the score,\n\n1 \u2264 Summation of o_{1}*o_{2} over all testcases \u2264 10^{4}\n\nSubtask 2: For further 20% of the score,\n1 \u2264 o_{1} \u2264 10^{4}\n1 \u2264 o_{2} \u2264 10^{2}\n\nSubtask 3: For further 70% of the score,\nNo further constraints.\n\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \n4\n5 1\n1 0 0 1 1\n3 3\n0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0\n3 3\n1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n3 3\n1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \n1\n1\n1\n0\n----- explanation 1 ------ \n\nIn the first testcase, each state should have only 1 district, and hence, there is no actual choice in constructing the states. There will be three One Governors, and two Zero Governors, and hence the President will be a One.\n\nIn the second testcase, each of the three states should should have 3 districts each. Consider the following partitioning of the districts into states: {2,3,4}, {5,6,7} and {8,9,1}. So, the first state consists of the districts {2,3,4}, and the representatives of these correspond to {0,1,1}. The majority is One, and hence the first state will have a One Governor. The representatives corresponding to the second state are {0,1,1}, and so again, this will have a One Governor. The third state has representatives {0,0,0}, and hence will have a Zero Governor. On the whole, there are two One Governors, and one Zero Governor, and hence the President will be a One. And since there is a way to partition the districts into states, in which the President is a One, the answer is 1.\n\nIn the third testcase, each of the three states should should have 3 districts each. Consider the following partitioning of the districts into states: {3,4,5}, {6,7,8} and {9,1,2}. So, the first state consists of the districts {3,4,5}, and the representatives of these correspond to {1,0,1}. The majority is One, and hence the first state will have a One Governor. The representatives corresponding to the second state are {0,0,1}, and since the majority is Zero, this will have a Zero Governor. The third state has representatives {0,1,1}, and as Ones are in majority, this will have a One Governor. On the whole, there are two One Governors, and one Zero Governor, and hence the President will be a One.

It is given that N = o_{1} * o_{2}, where o_{1} and o_{2} are odd integers.\n\nThere are only 2 political parties in BitLand: the Zeros and the Ones. There was an election, in which each district chose it's representative who is either a Zero or a One. We know this data. i.e. for each of the N districts, we know whether their representative is a Zero or a One.\n\nThe N districts should be partitioned into o_{1} states, where each state consists of o_{2} consecutive districts.\n\nFor example, if o_{1} = 5 and o_{2}=3, then N=15, and {1,2,3} would be a valid state. {2,3,4}, {13,14,15}, {14,15,1}, {15,1,2} are other examples of valid states. But {3,5,6} is not a valid state, because the districts are not consecutive.\n\nA state gets a One Governor if, among all the o_{2} district representatives belonging to it, there are more One district representatives than Zero representatives. And it gets a Governor who is from the Zero party, if the majority of its district representatives are from the Zero party. And because o_{2} is odd, there will be no ties.\n\nThe President of BitLand will be a One if the majority of the o_{1} state Governors are Ones. Otherwise, the President will be from the Zero party.\n\nBut the state boundaries have not been fixed yet. Given just the district-wise data (i.e. whether each district's representative is a Zero or a One), you need to find if there is a way to partition them into states such that the President is a One.\n\n------ Input ------ \n\nThe first line contains one integer, T, which is the number of testcases.\nThe first line of each testcase contains two space separated integers, o_{1} and o_{2}, which are the number of states, and number of districts in each state, respectively.\n\nThe next line of each testcase contains N = o_{1} * o_{2} space separated integers: d_{1}, d_{2}, .., d_{N}. If d_{i} is 1, then it signifies that District i has chosen a One representative. If d_{i} is 0, then they have a Zero representative.\n\n------ Output ------ \n\nEach testcase should be in a new line, and should contain 1, if the President can be a One, and 0 otherwise.\n\n------ Constraints ------ \n\nFor all subtasks you may assume that: \n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100o_{1},o_{2} will be odd positive integers.\n\n1 \u2264 Summation of o_{1}*o_{2} over all testcases \u2264 10^{6}\n0 \u2264 d_{i} \u2264 1\n\nSubtask 1: For 10% of the score,\n\n1 \u2264 Summation of o_{1}*o_{2} over all testcases \u2264 10^{4}\n\nSubtask 2: For further 20% of the score,\n1 \u2264 o_{1} \u2264 10^{4}\n1 \u2264 o_{2} \u2264 10^{2}\n\nSubtask 3: For further 70% of the score,\nNo further constraints.\n\n----- Sample Input 1 ------ \n4\n5 1\n1 0 0 1 1\n3 3\n0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0\n3 3\n1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n3 3\n1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0\n----- Sample Output 1 ------ \n1\n1\n1\n0\n----- explanation 1 ------ \n\nIn the first testcase, each state should have only 1 district, and hence, there is no actual choice in constructing the states. There will be three One Governors, and two Zero Governors, and hence the President will be a One.\n\nIn the second testcase, each of the three states should should have 3 districts each. Consider the following partitioning of the districts into states: {2,3,4}, {5,6,7} and {8,9,1}. So, the first state consists of the districts {2,3,4}, and the representatives of these correspond to {0,1,1}. The majority is One, and hence the first state will have a One Governor. The representatives corresponding to the second state are {0,1,1}, and so again, this will have a One Governor. The third state has representatives {0,0,0}, and hence will have a Zero Governor. On the whole, there are two One Governors, and one Zero Governor, and hence the President will be a One. And since there is a way to partition the districts into states, in which the President is a One, the answer is 1.\n\nIn the third testcase, each of the three states should should have 3 districts each. Consider the following partitioning of the districts into states: {3,4,5}, {6,7,8} and {9,1,2}. So, the first state consists of the districts {3,4,5}, and the representatives of these correspond to {1,0,1}. The majority is One, and hence the first state will have a One Governor. The representatives corresponding to the second state are {0,0,1}, and since the majority is Zero, this will have a Zero Governor. The third state has representatives {0,1,1}, and as Ones are in majority, this will have a One Governor. On the whole, there are two One Governors, and one Zero Governor, and hence the President will be a One.

These tutorial challenges are different. They break down algorithmic concepts into smaller challenges so that you can learn the algorithm by solving them.  They are intended for those who already know some programming, however. You could be a student majoring in computer science, a self-taught programmer, or an experienced developer who wants an active algorithms review.  Here's a great place to learn by doing!\n\nThe first series of challenges covers sorting. They are listed below:\n\nTutorial Challenges - Sorting  \n\nInsertion Sort challenges\n\nInsertion Sort 1 - Inserting\nInsertion Sort 2 - Sorting\nCorrectness and loop invariant\nRunning Time of Algorithms\n\nQuicksort challenges\n\nQuicksort 1 - Partition\nQuicksort 2 - Sorting\nQuicksort In-place (advanced)\nRunning time of Quicksort\n\nCounting sort challenges\n\nCounting Sort 1 - Counting\nCounting Sort 2 - Simple sort\nCounting Sort 3 - Preparing\nFull Counting Sort (advanced)\n\nThere will also be some challenges where you'll get to apply what you've learned using the completed algorithms.\n\nAbout the Challenges \n\nEach challenge will describe a scenario and you will code a solution. As you progress through the challenges, you will learn some important concepts in algorithms. In each challenge, you will receive input on STDIN and you will need to print the correct output to STDOUT.  \n\nThere may be time limits that will force you to make your code efficient.  If you receive a \"Terminated due to time out\" message when you submit your solution, you'll need to reconsider your method.  If you want to test your code locally, each test case can be downloaded, inputs and expected results, using hackos.  You earn hackos as you solve challenges, and you can spend them on these tests.\n\nFor many challenges, helper methods (like an array) will be provided for you to process the input into a useful format.

Tell Gargari, how to place bishops on the chessboard to get maximum amount of money.\n\nWe assume a cell is attacked by a bishop, if the cell is located on the same diagonal with the bishop (the cell, where the bishop is, also considered attacked by it).\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 2000).

On the next line print four integers: x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 (1 \u2264 x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \u2264 n), where x_{i} is the number of the row where the i-th bishop should be placed, y_{i} is the number of the column where the i-th bishop should be placed.

{"text": "### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: There are n cells, numbered 1,2,..., n from left to right. You have to place a robot at any cell initially. The robot must make exactly k moves.\n\nIn one move, the robot must move one cell to the left or right, provided that it doesn't move out of bounds. In other words, if the robot was in the cell i, it must move to either the cell i-1 or the cell i+1, as long as it lies between 1 and n (endpoints inclusive). The cells, in the order they are visited (including the cell the robot is placed), together make a good path.\n\nEach cell i has a value a_i associated with it. Let c_0, c_1, ..., c_k be the sequence of cells in a good path in the order they are visited (c_0 is the cell robot is initially placed, c_1 is the cell where the robot is after its first move, and so on; more formally, c_i is the cell that the robot is at after i moves). Then the value of the path is calculated as a_{c_0} + a_{c_1} + ... + a_{c_k}.\n\nYour task is to calculate the sum of values over all possible good paths. Since this number can be very large, output it modulo 10^9 + 7. Two good paths are considered different if the starting cell differs or there exists an integer i \u2208 [1, k] such that the current cell of the robot after exactly i moves is different in those paths.\n\nYou must process q updates to a and print the updated sum each time.

To solve the i-th problem Polycarp needs a_i/s minutes.\n\nPolycarp loves to watch series, and before solving each of the problems he will definitely watch one episode. After Polycarp watches an episode, his skill decreases by 10\\%, that is skill level s decreases to 0.9s. Each episode takes exactly 10 minutes to watch. When Polycarp decides to solve some problem, he firstly has to watch one episode, and only then he starts solving the problem without breaks for a_i/s minutes, where s is his current skill level. In calculation of a_i/s no rounding is performed, only division of integer value a_i by real value s happens.\n\nAlso, Polycarp can train for some time. If he trains for t minutes, he increases his skill by C \\cdot t, where C is some given positive real constant. Polycarp can train only before solving any problem (and before watching series).

Fortunately for him, there are n fast food restaurants on the circle, they are located in the 1-st, the (k + 1)-st, the (2k + 1)-st, and so on, the ((n-1)k + 1)-st cities, i.e. the distance between the neighboring cities with fast food restaurants is k km.\n\nSergey began his journey at some city s and traveled along the circle, making stops at cities each l km (l > 0), until he stopped in s once again. Sergey then forgot numbers s and l, but he remembers that the distance from the city s to the nearest fast food restaurant was a km, and the distance from the city he stopped at after traveling the first l km from s to the nearest fast food restaurant was b km. Sergey always traveled in the same direction along the circle, but when he calculated distances to the restaurants, he considered both directions.\n\nNow Sergey is interested in two integers.

The next city Sergey stopped at could also be at cities 2, 3, 5, 6. Let's loop through all possible combinations of these cities. If both s and the city of the first stop are at the city 2 (for example, l = 6), then Sergey is at s after the first stop already, so x = 1. In other pairs Sergey needs 1, 2, 3, or 6 stops to return to s, so y = 6.\n\nIn the second example Sergey was at cities with fast food restaurant both initially and after the first stop, so l is 2, 4, or 6. Thus x = 1, y = 3.\n\nIn the third example there is only one restaurant, so the possible locations of s and the first stop are: (6, 8) and (6, 4). For the first option l = 2, for the second l = 8.

Sergey always traveled in the same direction along the circle, but when he calculated distances to the restaurants, he considered both directions.\n\nNow Sergey is interested in two integers. The first integer x is the minimum number of stops (excluding the first) Sergey could have done before returning to s. The second integer y is the maximum number of stops (excluding the first) Sergey could have done before returning to s.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 100\\,000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of fast food restaurants on the circle and the distance between the neighboring restaurants, respectively.\n\nThe second line contains two integers a and b (0 <= a, b <= \\frac{k}{2})\u00a0\u2014 the distances to the nearest fast food restaurants from the initial city and from the city Sergey made the first stop at, respectively.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the two integers x and y.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 3\n1 1\n\nOutput\n1 6\n\nInput\n3 2\n0 0\n\nOutput\n1 3\n\nInput\n1 10\n5 3\n\nOutput\n5 5\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example the restaurants are located in the cities 1 and 4, the initial city s could be 2, 3, 5, or 6. The next city Sergey stopped at could also be at cities 2, 3, 5, 6. Let's loop through all possible combinations of these cities. If both s and the city of the first stop are at the city 2 (for example, l = 6), then Sergey is at s after the first stop already, so x = 1. In other pairs Sergey needs 1, 2, 3, or 6 stops to return to s, so y = 6.\n\nIn the second example Sergey was at cities with fast food restaurant both initially and after the first stop, so l is 2, 4, or 6. Thus x = 1, y = 3.\n\nIn the third example there is only one restaurant, so the possible locations of s and the first stop are: (6, 8) and (6, 4). For the first option l = 2, for the second l = 8. In both cases Sergey needs x=y=5 stops to go to s.", "answer": "```python\nfrom math import gcd\n(n, k) = map(int, input().split())\n(a, b) = map(int, input().split())\nnk = n * k\ncand1 = [gcd(nk, abs(i * k + b - a)) for i in range(n)]\ncand2 = [gcd(nk, abs(i * k - b - a)) for i in range(n)]\ncand3 = [gcd(nk, abs(i * k + b + a)) for i in range(n)]\ncand4 = [gcd(nk, abs(i * k - b + a)) for i in range(n)]\nma = max(max(cand1), max(cand2), max(cand3), max(cand4))\nmi = min(min(cand1), min(cand2), min(cand3), max(cand4))\nprint(nk // ma, nk // mi)\n\n<|EOT|>\n```", "difficulty": 2, "skill_types": ["Complete search"], "tags": ["Mathematics", "Complete search"]}

You can hack this problem only if you solve and lock both problems.\n\nYou are given a sequence of integers a=[a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n] of length n. Its subsequence is obtained by removing zero or more elements from the sequence a (they do not necessarily go consecutively). For example, for the sequence a=[11,20,11,33,11,20,11]:\n\n  [11,20,11,33,11,20,11], [11,20,11,33,11,20], [11,11,11,11], [20], [33,20] are subsequences (these are just some of the long list);  [40], [33,33], [33,20,20], [20,20,11,11] are not subsequences. \n\nSuppose that an additional non-negative integer k (1 <= k <= n) is given, then the subsequence is called optimal if:\n\n  it has a length of k and the sum of its elements is the maximum possible among all subsequences of length k;  and among all subsequences of length k that satisfy the previous item, it is lexicographically minimal. \n\nRecall that the sequence b=[b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_k] is lexicographically smaller than the sequence c=[c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_k] if the first element (from the left) in which they differ less in the sequence b than in c. Formally: there exists t (1 <= t <= k) such that b_1=c_1, b_2=c_2, ..., b_{t-1}=c_{t-1} and at the same time b_t<c_t. For example:\n\n  [10, 20, 20] lexicographically less than [10, 21, 1],  [7, 99, 99] is lexicographically less than [10, 21, 1],  [10, 21, 0] is lexicographically less than [10, 21, 1]. \n\nYou are given a sequence of a=[a_1,a_2,\\dots,a_n] and m requests, each consisting of two numbers k_j and pos_j (1 <= k <= n, 1 <= pos_j <= k_j).

First convert it to ASCII values:\n\n```104``` for ```h```, ```101``` for ```e``` and ```121``` for ```y```.\n\n\n2.

Formally, for all k=1,2,\\dots,n, it must hold b_1+b_2+\\cdots+b_k\\not=0\\,. \n\nIf an array b_1,b_2,\\dots, b_n with the required properties does not exist, you have to print NO.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1<= t <= 1000) \u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each testcase contains one integer n (1<= n<= 50) \u00a0\u2014 the length of the array a.\n\nThe second line of each testcase contains n integers a_1,a_2,\\dots, a_n (-50<= a_i<= 50) \u00a0\u2014 the elements of a.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each testcase, if there is not an array b_1,b_2,\\dots,b_n with the required properties, print a single line with the word NO.\n\nOtherwise print a line with the word YES, followed by a line with the n integers b_1,b_2,\\dots,b_n. \n\nIf there is more than one array b_1,b_2,\\dots,b_n satisfying the required properties, you can print any of them.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n4\n1 -2 3 -4\n3\n0 0 0\n5\n1 -1 1 -1 1\n6\n40 -31 -9 0 13 -40\n\nOutput\nYES\n1 -2 3 -4\nNO\nYES\n1 1 -1 1 -1\nYES\n-40 13 40 0 -9 -31\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nExplanation of the first testcase: An array with the desired properties is b=[1,-2,3,-4]. For this array, it holds:   The first element of b is 1.  The sum of the first two elements of b is -1.  The sum of the first three elements of b is 2.  The sum of the first four elements of b is -2. \n\nExplanation of the second testcase: Since all values in a are 0, any rearrangement b of a will have all elements equal to 0 and therefore it clearly cannot satisfy the second property described in the statement (for example because b_1=0). Hence in this case the answer is NO.\n\nExplanation of the third testcase: An array with the desired properties is b=[1, 1, -1, 1, -1]. For this array, it holds:   The first element of b is 1.  The sum of the first two elements of b is 2.  The sum of the first three elements of b is 1.  The sum of the first four elements of b is 2.  The sum of the first five elements of b is 1. \n\nExplanation of the fourth testcase: An array with the desired properties is b=[-40,13,40,0,-9,-31]. For this array, it holds:   The first element of b is -40.  The sum of the first two elements of b is -27.  The sum of the first three elements of b is 13.  The sum of the first four elements of b is 13.  The sum of the first five elements of b is 4.

You need to paint elements in colors, so that:   If we consider any color, all elements of this color must be divisible by the minimal element of this color.  The number of used colors must be minimized. \n\nFor example, it's fine to paint elements [40, 10, 60] in a single color, because they are all divisible by 10. You can use any color an arbitrary amount of times (in particular, it is allowed to use a color only once).

So the friends are faced with the problem: how to make all their ratings equal.\n\nOne way to change ratings is to willingly lose in some matches. Friends can form a party consisting of two to five (but not more than n) friends and play a match in the game. When the party loses, the rating of each of its members decreases by 1. A rating can't become negative, so r_{i} = 0 doesn't change after losing.\n\nThe friends can take part in multiple matches, each time making a party from any subset of friends (but remember about constraints on party size: from 2 to 5 members).\n\nThe friends want to make their ratings equal but as high as possible.\n\nHelp the friends develop a strategy of losing the matches so that all their ratings become equal and the resulting rating is maximum possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of friends.\n\nThe second line contains n non-negative integers r_1, r_2, ..., r_{n} (0 \u2264 r_{i} \u2264 100), where r_{i} is the initial rating of the i-th friend.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line, print a single integer R \u2014 the final rating of each of the friends.\n\nIn the second line, print integer t \u2014 the number of matches the friends have to play. Each of the following t lines should contain n characters '0' or '1', where the j-th character of the i-th line is equal to:\n\n  '0', if friend j should not play in match i,  '1', if friend j should play in match i. \n\nEach line should contain between two and five characters '1', inclusive.\n\nThe value t should not exceed 10^4, it is guaranteed that such solution exists. \n\nRemember that you shouldn't minimize the value t, but you should maximize R. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5\n4 5 1 7 4\n\nOutput\n1\n8\n01010\n00011\n01010\n10010\n00011\n11000\n00011\n11000\n\nInput\n2\n1 2\n\nOutput\n0\n2\n11\n11\n\nInput\n3\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\n1\n0", "answer": "```python\nn = int(input())\nd = list(map(int, input().split()))\nanswer = []\nwhile not all((i == d[0] for i in d)):\n    i = max(range(n), key=lambda x: d[x])\n    max1 = d[i]\n    d[i] = -1\n    j = max(range(n), key=lambda x: d[x])\n    max2 = d[j]\n    d[j] = -1\n    z = max(range(n), key=lambda x: d[x])\n    if max1 == max2 and max1 == d[z]:\n        for t in range(n):\n            if t != i and t != j and (t != z):\n                break\n        if all((d[v] == d[t] for v in range(n) if v != i and v != j and (v != z))) and d[t] < max1:\n            d[i] = max1 - 1\n            d[j] = max2 - 1\n            d[z] -= 1\n            answer.append(''.join(('1' if k == i or k == j or k == z else '0' for k in range(n))))\n            continue\n    d[i] = max(max1 - 1, 0)\n    d[j] = max(max2 - 1, 0)\n    answer.append(''.join(('1' if k == i or k == j else '0' for k in range(n))))\nprint(d[0])\nprint(len(answer))\nfor i in answer:\n    print(i)\n\n<|EOT|>\n```", "difficulty": 2, "skill_types": ["Greedy algorithms"], "tags": ["Implementation", "Greedy algorithms"]}

For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones\n\nVasya also knows what a chord is.

Finally, Natasha sat in the rocket. She flies, flies... but gets bored. She wishes to arrive to Mars already! So she decides to find something to occupy herself. She couldn't think of anything better to do than to calculate the distance to the red planet.\n\nLet's define x as the distance to Mars. Unfortunately, Natasha does not know x. But it is known that 1 \u2264 x \u2264 m, where Natasha knows the number m. Besides, x and m are positive integers.\n\nNatasha can ask the rocket questions. Every question is an integer y (1 \u2264 y \u2264 m). The correct answer to the question is -1, if x<y, 0, if x=y, and 1, if x>y. But the rocket is broken \u2014 it does not always answer correctly. Precisely: let the correct answer to the current question be equal to t, then, if the rocket answers this question correctly, then it will answer t, otherwise it will answer -t.\n\nIn addition, the rocket has a sequence p of length n. Each element of the sequence is either 0 or 1. The rocket processes this sequence in the cyclic order, that is 1-st element, 2-nd, 3-rd, \u2026, (n-1)-th, n-th, 1-st, 2-nd, 3-rd, \u2026, (n-1)-th, n-th, \u2026.

If you ignore this, you can get any verdict, since your program will continue to read from the closed input stream.\n\nIf at some point your program reads -2 as an answer, it must immediately end (for example, by calling exit(0)).

{"text": "### Instruction: Write a Python program that solves the following question. \nQuestion: On a chessboard with a width of 10^9 and a height of 10^9, the rows are numbered from bottom to top from 1 to 10^9, and the columns are numbered from left to right from 1 to 10^9. Therefore, for each cell of the chessboard you can assign the coordinates (x,y), where x is the column number and y is the row number.\n\nEvery day there are fights between black and white pieces on this board. Today, the black ones won, but at what price? Only the rook survived, and it was driven into the lower left corner \u2014 a cell with coordinates (1,1). But it is still happy, because the victory has been won and it's time to celebrate it! In order to do this, the rook needs to go home, namely \u2014 on the upper side of the field (that is, in any cell that is in the row with number 10^9).\n\nEverything would have been fine, but the treacherous white figures put spells on some places of the field before the end of the game. There are two types of spells: \n\n  * Vertical. Each of these is defined by one number x. Such spells create an infinite blocking line between the columns x and x+1. \n  * Horizontal. Each of these is defined by three numbers x_1, x_2, y. Such spells create a blocking segment that passes through the top side of the cells, which are in the row y and in columns from x_1 to x_2 inclusive. The peculiarity of these spells is that it is impossible for a certain pair of such spells to have a common point. Note that horizontal spells can have common points with vertical spells. \n\n<image> An example of a chessboard.\n\nLet's recall that the rook is a chess piece that in one move can move to any point that is in the same row or column with its initial position. In our task, the rook can move from the cell (r_0,c_0) into the cell (r_1,c_1) only under the condition that r_1 = r_0 or c_1 = c_0 and there is no blocking lines or blocking segments between these cells (For better understanding, look at the samples).\n\nFortunately, the rook can remove spells, but for this it has to put tremendous efforts, therefore, it wants to remove the minimum possible number of spells in such way, that after this it can return home. Find this number!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (0 \u2264 n,m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of vertical and horizontal spells.\n\nEach of the following n lines contains one integer x (1 \u2264 x < 10^9) \u2014 the description of the vertical spell. It will create a blocking line between the columns of x and x+1.\n\nEach of the following m lines contains three integers x_1, x_2 and y (1 \u2264 x_{1} \u2264 x_{2} \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 y < 10^9) \u2014 the numbers that describe the horizontal spell. It will create a blocking segment that passes through the top sides of the cells that are in the row with the number y, in columns from x_1 to x_2 inclusive.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all spells are different, as well as the fact that for each pair of horizontal spells it is true that the segments that describe them do not have common points.\n\nOutput\n\nIn a single line print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of spells the rook needs to remove so it can get from the cell (1,1) to at least one cell in the row with the number 10^9\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n2 3\n6\n8\n1 5 6\n1 9 4\n2 4 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n\nInput\n\n1 3\n4\n1 5 3\n1 9 4\n4 6 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n\nInput\n\n0 2\n1 1000000000 4\n1 1000000000 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n\nInput\n\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n0\n\nInput\n\n2 3\n4\n6\n1 4 3\n1 5 2\n1 6 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first sample, in order for the rook return home, it is enough to remove the second horizontal spell.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first sample.

Therefore, for each cell of the chessboard you can assign the coordinates (x,y), where x is the column number and y is the row number.\n\nEvery day there are fights between black and white pieces on this board. Today, the black ones won, but at what price? Only the rook survived, and it was driven into the lower left corner \u2014 a cell with coordinates (1,1). But it is still happy, because the victory has been won and it's time to celebrate it! In order to do this, the rook needs to go home, namely \u2014 on the upper side of the field (that is, in any cell that is in the row with number 10^9).\n\nEverything would have been fine, but the treacherous white figures put spells on some places of the field before the end of the game. There are two types of spells: \n\n  * Vertical. Each of these is defined by one number x. Such spells create an infinite blocking line between the columns x and x+1. \n  * Horizontal. Each of these is defined by three numbers x_1, x_2, y. Such spells create a blocking segment that passes through the top side of the cells, which are in the row y and in columns from x_1 to x_2 inclusive. The peculiarity of these spells is that it is impossible for a certain pair of such spells to have a common point. Note that horizontal spells can have common points with vertical spells. \n\n<image> An example of a chessboard.\n\nLet's recall that the rook is a chess piece that in one move can move to any point that is in the same row or column with its initial position. In our task, the rook can move from the cell (r_0,c_0) into the cell (r_1,c_1) only under the condition that r_1 = r_0 or c_1 = c_0 and there is no blocking lines or blocking segments between these cells (For better understanding, look at the samples).\n\nFortunately, the rook can remove spells, but for this it has to put tremendous efforts, therefore, it wants to remove the minimum possible number of spells in such way, that after this it can return home. Find this number!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (0 \u2264 n,m \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of vertical and horizontal spells.\n\nEach of the following n lines contains one integer x (1 \u2264 x < 10^9) \u2014 the description of the vertical spell. It will create a blocking line between the columns of x and x+1.\n\nEach of the following m lines contains three integers x_1, x_2 and y (1 \u2264 x_{1} \u2264 x_{2} \u2264 10^9, 1 \u2264 y < 10^9) \u2014 the numbers that describe the horizontal spell. It will create a blocking segment that passes through the top sides of the cells that are in the row with the number y, in columns from x_1 to x_2 inclusive.\n\nIt is guaranteed that all spells are different, as well as the fact that for each pair of horizontal spells it is true that the segments that describe them do not have common points.\n\nOutput\n\nIn a single line print one integer \u2014 the minimum number of spells the rook needs to remove so it can get from the cell (1,1) to at least one cell in the row with the number 10^9\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n2 3\n6\n8\n1 5 6\n1 9 4\n2 4 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n\nInput\n\n1 3\n4\n1 5 3\n1 9 4\n4 6 6\n\n\nOutput\n\n1\n\nInput\n\n0 2\n1 1000000000 4\n1 1000000000 2\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n\nInput\n\n0 0\n\n\nOutput\n\n0\n\nInput\n\n2 3\n4\n6\n1 4 3\n1 5 2\n1 6 5\n\n\nOutput\n\n2\n\nNote\n\nIn the first sample, in order for the rook return home, it is enough to remove the second horizontal spell.\n\n<image> Illustration for the first sample.

The user who sent the first request was online from 17:05:53 to 17:06:02, the user who sent the second request was online from 17:05:58 to 17:06:07, the user who sent the third request, was online from 17:06:01 to 17:06:10. Thus, these IDs cannot belong to three distinct users, because in that case all these users would be online, for example, at 17:06:01. That is impossible, because M = 2. That means that some two of these queries belonged to the same user. One of the correct variants is given in the answer to the sample. For it user 1 was online from 17:05:53 to 17:06:02, user 2 \u2014 from 17:05:58 to 17:06:10 (he sent the second and third queries), user 3 \u2014 from 22:39:47 to 22:39:56.\n\nIn the second sample there is only one query. So, only one user visited the network within the 24-hour period and there couldn't be two users online on the network simultaneously.
